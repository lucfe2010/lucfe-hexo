Library of Congress Classification (LCC) Libraries in the United States generally use either the Library of Congress Classification System (LC) or the Dewey Decimal Classification System to organize their books. Most academic libraries use LC, and most public libraries and K-12 school libraries use Dewey. Colon classification (CC) he first edition of colon classification was published in 1933,[1] followed by six more editions. It is especially used in libraries in India.

B.C.ECommon Era (CE) and Before the Common Era (BCE) are year notations for the Gregorian calendar (and its predecessor, the Julian calendar), the world’s most widely used calendar era. Common Era and Before the Common Era are alternatives to the original Anno Domini (AD) and Before Christ (BC) notations used for the same calendar era. The term anno Domini is Medieval Latin and means “in the year of the Lord” This calendar era is based on the traditionally reckoned year of the conception or birth of Jesus, AD counting years from the start of this epoch and BC denoting years before the start of the era. There is no year zero in this scheme; thus the year AD 1 immediately follows the year 1

黄帝即黄色的帝王，发明了弓箭、船只、马车、陶器、文字以及丝绸，在黄河流域的大平原，为五帝之首 尧，据说制定了历法和礼仪，他没有把权力传给没名望的亲生儿子，而选择了舜做继承人 舜是一个贫苦的农民，他全心全意地服侍他的瞎眼父亲和邪恶的继母，这说明了他的孝 舜任命了一位官员–禹去处理洪水。此后十多年里，禹穿越土地、疏通河道，把洪水变成了华北的河流。禹治水是如此专心，以致他几次经过自己的家门，都没有停一下去看望自己的妻儿。舜指定禹为他的继承人。禹把统治区域划分为九州，铸了九鼎作为各州的象征。 禹死后，人们无视他指定的继承人而拥护他的儿子启来领导他们，开了世袭王朝统治的先河 禹和他的儿子便成为夏王朝最先的两个王 夏朝的统治延续了14代 到夏桀这个暴君被他的一个下属废黜时，夏朝被推翻，篡权者建立了他自己的王朝–商 商朝的统治延续了30代，直至一个荒淫无道、不听劝谏的王失去他的贵族和人民的支持，而被至西而来的周朝的军队轻而易举地推翻。 上古三代–夏、商、周

Adjectives Pronouns Verbs Adverbs Prepositions Conjunctions Interjections 句型一：主语＋系动词＋表语该句型的谓语动词是系动词（如be或其他系动词）。所谓系动词，又叫联系动词（linking verb），顾名思义，这种动词并不表示具体的动作，而只是起连接主语和后面成分的作用。这种动词后面所接的成分是用来说明主语的特点，表明主语的性质特征的，因此我们称之为主语补足语，或表语（能表示主语特征的成分）。 用作表语的词通常是名词和形容词The music sounds nice. 这音乐很好听。He became a teacher. 他成了一名老师。 四大类单纯表示主语的特征、状态的这样的系动词有feel, look, sound, taste, smell, seem和appear等。请看例句：2 The iron feels hot. 这块铁摸起来很热。3 The rose doesn’t smell much. 这玫瑰花不是很香。 表示主语由一种状态转变为另一种状态的这样的系动词有become, grow, get, turn, fall, go和come等。例如：The leaf will turn yellow in autumn. 叶子秋天就会变黄。The teacher became angry. 老师生气了。 go comego作为系动词时，一般用于贬义，即表示主语是朝着坏的或消极的一面改变。相反，come作为系动词，则是表示褒义的，即表示主语是朝着好的或积极的一面改变。请看例句：go wrong 出错了Hope your dreams will come true. 祝你好梦成真。 表示主语保持某种状态的这样的系动词有continue, remain, stay, keep, hold, rest和prove等。请看例句：He has fallen into the habit of doing morning exercises to stay healthy.不要说stay healthily，因为副词不能作表语。为了保持健康，他已经养成了晨练的习惯。 近似于不及物动词的系动词近似于不及物动词的系动词有sit, act, arrive, blush, marry, die和be born等。有人将其称为“半系动词”，因为它们介于不及物动词和系动词之间。读者对这些系动词只需了解，并且在遇到相关句子时能够正确理解即可。 句型二：主语＋谓语该句型的谓语动词是不及物动词（intransitive verb），所表示的动作没有作用对象，其本身的意思完整，其后不需带宾语。在词典中表示为vi.。 The fire is burning 状语谓语动词的后面虽然不接宾语，但通常会接副词（如hard）或介词短语（如in the west）来说明动作的方式、地点或时间等等。英文中把这种修饰动作的成分称作状语。 They shouted loudly. 这里的副词loudly表示动作的方式，叫做方式状语。 He died at home. 这里的介词短语at home表示动作的地点，叫做地点状语。 He died in 2007. 这里的介词短语in 2007表示动作的时间，叫做时间状语。 区分“主系表”和“主谓状”两种句型请注意比较： He shouted loudly. He looks happy. 在例句1）中，shouted是不及物动词，副词loudly修饰动作shouted，作状语。在例句2）中，looks是系动词，没有具体的动作。形容词happy不是修饰looks的，而是补充说明主语he的特征，作表语。 句型三：主语＋谓语＋宾语该句型的谓语动词是及物动词（transitive verb），这种动词告诉我们由主语发出的动作所作用的对象是什么，这里所作用的对象就是我们通常称之为宾语的，即宾语是主语动作的承受对象，因此这类动词是带有宾语的。英文中的绝大多数动词都是及物动词，在词典中标为vt.。 同时是及物动词与不及物动词 These children are playing football. These children are playing. 在例句1）中，play用作及物动词，其后面带有名词football作为play的作用对象，即宾语。在例句2）中，play用作不及物动词，其后面没有宾语。 英语中大多数动词都像play一样，既可以用作及物动词，又可以用作不及物动词，但意思和用法都不一样。 句型四：主语＋谓语＋间接宾语＋直接宾语该句型的谓语动词是双宾动词（dative verb），这种动词的后面所接成分有“人”又有“物”。一般来讲，这里的“人”表示动作的接受者，称作间接宾语（indirect object）。“物”表示动作作用的对象，是动作的承受者，称作直接宾语（direct object）。间接宾语和直接宾语合起来叫做双宾语。 句型五：主语＋谓语＋宾语＋宾语补足语该句型中的谓语动词是宾补动词（factitive verb），这种动词的后面接宾语，而此宾语的后面又接补充说明宾语的补足语（objectcomplement）。宾语和宾语补足语合起来叫做复合宾语。 区分双宾语和复合宾语“主语＋谓语＋双宾语”句型和“主语＋谓语＋复合宾语”句型 在宾语的后面加上be动词，若能构成一个语义通顺的句子，则是补足语。 因为宾语与宾语补足语的语义关系就相当于主语与主语补足语的关系，即类似一个“主系表”结构，所以，在宾语的后面添上一个系动词be，自然就应该能构成一个逻辑语义通顺的句子。 而间接宾语与直接宾语之间就没有这样的语义关系，所以，添上be之后，自然就不能构成一个语义通顺的句子。 I made John our chairman. I made John a cake. 在例句1）中，在宾语John的后面添上一个is，即John is our chairman.这说得通，所以例句1）中的our chairman是宾语补足语。相反，在例句2）中，在宾语John的后面添上一个is，即John is a cake.*（约翰是一块蛋糕。）这显然讲不通，所以例句2）是一个双宾语结构，a cake是一个直接宾语。 英语句子的主要成分英语句子的基本成分与一般句子结构类似，以下是英语句子的主要成分： 主语（Subject）：主语是句子中执行动作或被描述的主要对象或主体。主语通常是一个名词、代词或名词短语，它执行动词所表示的动作或状态。例如：She (她) is reading a book (正在读一本书)。 谓语（Predicate）：谓语是句子中描述主语动作、状态或属性的部分。它通常由一个动词或动词短语构成。例如：is reading (正在读)。 宾语（Object）：宾语是动作的接受者或受影响的对象，它通常是一个名词、代词或名词短语。有时也有间接宾语，它是谓语动作的间接受益者。例如：a book (一本书)。 补语（Complement）：补语是用来补充或描述主语或宾语的成分，它通常出现在动词之后，有时也可以出现在名词之后。例如：happy (高兴)。 状语（Adverbial）：状语是用来修饰动词、形容词、副词或整个句子的成分，它提供关于时间、地点、方式、原因等方面的信息。例如：yesterday (昨天)、quickly (快速地)、because of the rain (因为下雨)。 定语（Modifier）：定语是用来修饰名词或代词的成分，它提供关于名词或代词的额外信息。定语可以是形容词、限定性从句、不定式短语等。例如：the red car (红色的汽车)、the man who is standing (站着的那个人)。 连词（Conjunction）：连词是用来连接句子中不同部分的词语，使句子更加连贯。常见的连词包括”and”（和）、”but”（但是）、”because”（因为）等。 标点符号：标点符号如句号、问号、感叹号、逗号等在句子中起到分隔和标记的作用，帮助读者理解句子的结构和含义。 这些成分构成了英语句子的基本结构，根据不同的句子类型和句子复杂程度，这些成分可以组合和变化。 补语补语是一种用来补充或描述主语或宾语的成分，它可以分为以下几种分类，每种分类都有不同的类型和例子： 表语（Predicative Complement）： 表语是一种补语，通常出现在系动词（linking verb）后面，用来描述主语的状态、性质或身份。 例如： She is happy.（她很开心。） The flowers smell lovely.（这些花闻起来很可爱。） He became a doctor.（他成为了一名医生。） 宾补（Object Complement）： 宾补是一种补语，通常出现在及物动词后，用来进一步描述宾语。 例如： They painted the wall white.（他们把墙刷成了白色。） I find her behavior rude.（我认为她的行为粗鲁。） He considers the book his favorite.（他把这本书视为自己的最爱。） 主补（Subject Complement）： 主补是一种补语，出现在系动词后，描述主语的性质或状态。 例如： She seems tired.（她看起来很疲倦。） The cake smells delicious.（这个蛋糕闻起来很美味。） He is a good friend.（他是个好朋友。） 地点补语（Locative Complement）： 地点补语用来指示动作发生的地点或位置。 例如： They found the treasure buried underground.（他们找到了埋在地下的宝藏。） The cat sat on the roof.（猫坐在屋顶上。） 时间补语（Temporal Complement）： 时间补语用来指示动作发生的时间或时期。 例如： She will meet you tomorrow.（她明天会见你。） They finished the project in a week.（他们在一周内完成了这个项目。） 这些是补语的一些常见分类，每种类型都有不同的例子，帮助描述句子中的不同方面。注意，具体的例子可能会因句子结构和动词选择的不同而有所变化。 从句一个句子除了有主语和谓语之外，其他可能包含的成分还有宾语、表语、定语、状语、补语和同位语等。在这些成分中，谓语较为特殊，只能由动词来充当，而其他成分则可以由词、短语或者句子来充当。 定语定语是用来修饰、限定、说明名词或代词的品质与特征的。 定语的位置一般有两种：用在所修饰词之前的叫前置定语，用在所修饰词之后的叫后置定语定语和中心语之间是修饰和被修饰、限制和被限制的关系。 形容词遵循的词序为：限 观 形 龄 颜 国 材 用指：限定词（一般指数量） -&gt; 外观（美丽等） -&gt; 形状（大小，高矮，肥瘦） -&gt; 年龄 -&gt; 颜色 -&gt; 国籍 -&gt; 材料 -&gt; 用途。 an interesting little red French oil painting 定语是一种用来修饰名词或代词的成分，它提供了有关名词或代词的额外信息。定语可以根据其性质和功能进行分类，以下是一些定语的常见分类和相应的例子： 形容词性定语（Adjective Modifiers）： 形容词性定语是形容词或形容词短语，用来描述名词的性质或特征。 例如： A beautiful sunset (一个美丽的日落) The blue sky (蓝色的天空) An expensive car (一辆昂贵的汽车) 限定性定语从句（Restrictive Relative Clauses）： 限定性定语从句是由关系词引导的从句，用来限定或修饰名词，它通常不带逗号。 例如： The book that I bought is interesting. (我买的那本书很有趣。) The person who called you is my friend. (给你打电话的那个人是我的朋友。) 非限定性定语从句（Non-Restrictive Relative Clauses）： 非限定性定语从句也是由关系词引导的从句，但它用来提供附加信息，通常用逗号将其与主句分开。 例如： My sister, who is a doctor, lives in New York. (我妹妹，她是一名医生，住在纽约。) The Eiffel Tower, which is in Paris, is famous. (埃菲尔铁塔，它位于巴黎，很有名。) 不定式定语（Infinitive Modifiers）： 不定式定语是由不定式短语（to + 动词原形）构成的，用来修饰名词或代词，通常表达目的、目标或用途。 例如： I need a pen to write a letter. (我需要一支笔来写信。) She has a plan to start a business. (她有一个开办业务的计划。) 名词性定语（Noun Modifiers）： 名词性定语是一个名词或名词短语，用来修饰另一个名词，通常表示名词之间的关系。 例如： The book cover (书的封面) A student union (学生会) The car keys (汽车钥匙) 这些是一些常见的定语分类和相应的例子。定语在句子中起到非常重要的作用，帮助我们更清晰地理解名词或代词所表示的事物或概念。 词语词语在语法和语义上可以分为多种类别，以下是一些常见的词语类别以及相应的例子： 名词（Noun）：名词是用来表示人、事物、地点或概念的词语。 例如：dog (狗)、book (书)、city (城市)、love (爱) 动词（Verb）：动词是表示动作、状态或事件的词语。 例如：run (跑)、eat (吃)、think (思考)、sing (唱) 形容词（Adjective）：形容词用来描述名词的性质或特征。 例如：happy (快乐的)、big (大的)、beautiful (美丽的)、red (红色的) 副词（Adverb）：副词用来修饰动词、形容词、副词或整个句子，提供关于时间、地点、方式、程度等信息。 例如：quickly (迅速地)、very (非常)、here (这里)、now (现在) 代词（Pronoun）：代词用来替代名词，以避免重复使用名词。 例如：he (他)、she (她)、it (它)、they (他们) 介词（Preposition）：介词用来表示名词与其他词语之间的关系，通常表达时间、地点、方向等。 例如：in (在)、on (在…上)、under (在…下面)、between (在…之间) 连词（Conjunction）：连词用来连接词语、短语或句子，使句子更加连贯。 例如：and (和)、but (但是)、because (因为)、or (或者) 感叹词（Interjection）：感叹词用来表示情感或强调，通常独立出现并用感叹号标记。 例如：Oh! (哦)、Wow! (哇)、Alas! (唉) 冠词（Article）：冠词是一种特殊的限定词，包括定冠词 “the”（定冠词）和不定冠词 “a” 或 “an”（不定冠词），用来限定名词的特定性或泛指性。 例如：the (这)、a (一个)、an (一个) 助动词（Auxiliary Verb）：助动词用来辅助主要动词，例如表示时态、语态、情态等。 例如：be (是)、have (有)、can (能)、will (将) 这些是一些常见的词语类别，不同类别的词语在句子中扮演不同的角色和功能，帮助构建和传达语言信息。请注意，有些词语可能属于多个类别，具体分类可能根据语法规则和上下文而有所不同。 限定词限定词是在名词词组中对名词中心词起特指、类指以及表示确定数量和非确定数量等限定作用的词类。是特指还是类指（即泛指一类人或物），是有确定的数量还是没有确定的数量。能在名词词组中表示这种所指意义的词类就是限定词。 限定词修饰某个名词，以限定名词所指的范围，对名词起泛指或特指、定量或不定量等限定修饰作用。 限定词的选择决定于随后的名词的类别，是单数名词、复数名词，还是不可数名词。 限定词（Determiners）是英语语法中的一类词汇，通常出现在名词前，用来限定名词或指示名词的数量、特定性、所属关系等。限定词在句子中的作用是帮助我们更清晰地理解名词的含义，而且它们与名词的搭配方式也常常受到语法规则的约束。 以下是一些常见的限定词以及它们的作用： 冠词（Articles）：冠词包括”the”（定冠词）和”a”或”an”（不定冠词）。它们用来指示名词的特定性或泛指性。 例如：The cat (这只猫)、A book (一本书)、An apple (一个苹果) 指示代词（Demonstratives）：指示代词包括”this”（这）, “that”（那）, “these”（这些）和”those”（那些），用来指示名词的位置或特定对象。 例如：This car (这辆车)、Those people (那些人) 数量词（Quantifiers）：数量词用来表示名词的数量或程度，包括”some”（一些）, “many”（许多）, “few”（少数）, “several”（若干）等。 例如：Many students (许多学生)、Few books (少数书籍)、Some water (一些水) 所有格（Possessives）：所有格词表示名词所属的关系，包括名词的所有者，常见的有”my”（我的）, “his”（他的）, “their”（他们的）等。 例如：My car (我的车)、Her house (她的房子)、Their dog (他们的狗) 疑问词（Interrogatives）：疑问词用于构成疑问句，包括”who”（谁）, “which”（哪个）, “what”（什么）等。 例如：Who is coming? (谁来了？)、Which book do you want? (你想要哪本书？) 不定代词（Indefinites）：不定代词用于泛指或表示不确定性，包括”some”（一些）, “any”（任何），”none”（没有）等。 例如：Some people (一些人)、Any information (任何信息)、None of them (他们中没有一个) 限定词是构建句子时非常重要的一部分，它们有助于明确名词的含义、数量、所属关系等，从而使句子更加清晰和具体。 冠词（ARTICLE）是最典型的限定词冠词的表意功能可以归纳为二种，即类指（GENERIC REFERENCE）和特指（SPECIFIC REFERENCE）。 所谓泛指，也叫类指，顾名思义，是表示一类事物，或某类事物的总称。所谓特指，是表示某类事物中的具体的某一个或某一些。 冠词（Article）是一种虚词，并非只存在于英语中，而是普遍存在于印欧语系和闪含语系中。冠词在句子中一般不重读，本身不能独立使用，只能与名词放在一起（一般用于名词之前 ）帮助说明名词所指的人或事物。 冠词的类型包括不定冠词（Indefinite Article）、定冠词（Definite Article）、否定冠词（Negative Article）、部分冠词（Partitive Article）和零冠词（Zero Article，即不用冠词）。 不定冠词表示泛指、类指a、an，仅用在单数可数名词前来表示“一”的意义，但不强调数目概念，只表示名词为不特定者。 定冠词表示特指、专指定冠词the，表示名词的特定者，表示“这”·“那”·“这些”·“那些”，用在可数名词单数、复数，不可数名词前均可 冠词the表特指，就是指根据说话者和听话者共有的知识，或根据上下文，可以识别的独特的某物。换句话说，说话者用the是想要听话者找到双方心中都知道的所指， 情景／文化特指（situational/cultural reference）定冠词the用于这一类特指，必须依赖于说话者和听话者双方共有的知识。因为既然是要特指某事物，那么就应该是说话者与听话者双方都知道的，或者说是说话者认为听话者应该知道的。换句话说，我们使用定冠词the是说明“我——作者或说话者（writer/speaker）可以断定你——读者或听者（reader/listener）知道我在指谁或在指什么”。 一般常识（general knowledge）／较大情景the moon 月亮 具体知识（specific knowledge）／局部情景（local use） Have you visited the castle? 在某一城镇就只有一个城堡。 你去看过那个城堡了吗？ 即时情景用法（immediate situation）在说话的时刻，所指为双方唯一看到或听到的。此时，定冠词the的所指是从语言以外的实境（the extralinguistic situation）中推知的。The roses are very beautiful 上下文共指（textual co-reference）上下文共指，就是指听话者或读者可以根据上下文找到所指。它可分为前指（anaphoric reference）和后指（cataphoric reference）。前指又可分为直接前指（direct anaphora）和间接前指（indirect anaphora）。 直接前指前面话语中已经提供的信息使后文中的某个名词短语特指某个事物，这即是前指。直接前指是指前面提到的某个事物，在后文中再次提到，这样前后两个名词短语是一种共指关系（co-reference），指代同一个事物。由于第一次提到的物体通常是不定指的，所以常用不定冠词a/an来限定。可是一旦那个物体在话语中已经谈到过，就可以把它看作“从上文中已得知的东西”，此后再提到它时就要用定冠词。这就是传统语法书上所说的，“第一次提到的单数可数名词前面用不定冠词a或an，这一名词再次出现时则要用定冠词the”。请看下面的例句：1 I had a banana and an apple. I ate the banana and gave the apple to Clint 间接前指／话题与定冠词the间接前指，表示所指的对象间接地成为听话者知识的一部分。这种知识不是通过上面讨论的那样的直接谈及而获得，而是从已经谈到的事物中推断得到的。此时，在上文中往往会提到的一个与下文有紧密联系的概念或谈论的话题，然后下文围绕这个话题展开讨论。比如：9 John bought a bicycle, but when he rode it one of the wheels came off 后指／结构特指后指，也叫结构特指（structural reference），往往出现在带有后置定语的名词短语中。一般来说，被某个后置定语所修饰的名词的前面要用定冠词the。比如：14 The brick house on the corner is mine. 零冠词表示泛指人或事物、类指复数可数名词和不可数名词前不用冠词，也表泛指，有些语法专家称之为“零冠词”。 副词副词（Adverbs）是英语中的一类词汇，用来修饰动词、形容词、副词或整个句子，以提供更多信息，如时间、地点、方式、程度、原因等。副词在句子中的作用是丰富描述，并帮助读者或听者更好地理解动作、状态或事件。 以下是一些常见副词的用法和例子： 时间副词（Adverbs of Time）：这些副词用来描述动作发生的时间。 例如：now (现在)、today (今天)、soon (很快)、yesterday (昨天) 地点副词（Adverbs of Place）：这些副词用来描述动作发生的地点或位置。 例如：here (这里)、there (那里)、everywhere (到处)、below (在下面) 方式副词（Adverbs of Manner）：这些副词用来描述动作的方式或方式。 例如：quickly (迅速地)、carefully (仔细地)、loudly (大声地)、happily (高兴地) 程度副词（Adverbs of Degree）：这些副词用来表示动作或状态的程度。 例如：very (非常)、extremely (极其)、quite (相当)、too (太) 频率副词（Adverbs of Frequency）：这些副词用来描述动作发生的频率。 例如：always (总是)、often (经常)、rarely (很少)、never (从不) 原因副词（Adverbs of Reason）：这些副词用来表示原因或解释为什么发生某事。 例如：because (因为)、therefore (因此)、so (所以)、thus (因此) 连接副词（Conjunctive Adverbs）：这些副词用来连接句子或句子成分，通常出现在句子中，前后需要逗号分隔。 例如：however (然而)、therefore (因此)、meanwhile (与此同时)、consequently (因此) 副词的使用可以丰富语言表达，使句子更加准确和生动。它们可以用来回答各种问题，例如何时、在哪里、如何、为什么等等。","link":"/lucfe-hexo/0002%20Social%20science/%E8%AF%AD%E8%A8%80%E5%AD%A6%20Linguistics%20and%20languages/english%20grammar/"},{"title":"","text":"finance wikiT-NOTE国库券A Treasury note (T-note for short) is a marketable U.S. government debt security with a fixed interest rate and a maturity between two and 10 years. security 证券a certificate attesting证明 credit信用, the ownership of stocks or bonds, or the right to ownership connected with tradable derivatives.衍生品 T-BONDTreasury bonds (T-bonds) are government debt securities issued by the U.S. Federal government that have maturities greater than 20 years.

It was owned by Intercontinental Exchange. It merged with the New York Stock Exchange in 2006 and now operates as a subsidiary of the NYSE Group, Inc. NYSE Arca is an electronic securities exchange in the U.S. on which exchange-traded products (ETPs) and equities are listed. The exchange specializes in ETP listings, which include exchange-traded funds (ETFs), exchange-traded notes (ETNs), and exchange-traded vehicles (ETVs). Exchange traded products (ETPs) are types of securities that track underlying securities, an index, or other financial instruments. ETPs trade on exchanges similar to stocks meaning their prices can fluctuate from day-to-day and intraday. However, the prices of ETPs are derived from the underlying investments that they track. GOLDGold exchange-traded products may include exchange-traded funds (ETFs), exchange-traded notes (ETNs), and closed-end funds (CEFs), which are traded like shares on the major stock exchanges.ETN（Exchange-Traded Notes）即交易所交易债券或交易所交易票据，一般为投资银行发行的债券类产品。最早由巴克莱银行（Barclays Bank PLC）于 2006 年发行。这种债券之所以不同于其它形式的债券，主要是来自于它的报酬，ETN 的报 酬是基于特定市场指数的报酬，减去必要费用，并不支付固定利息，且不保障本 金。因此，ETN 可以理解为债券与 ETF 部分特征的结合，是一种结构化产品，在交易所交易，利息通常只有在卖出时才会支付 SILVERCOPPER COMEXThe New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX) is a commodity futures exchange owned and operated by CME Group of Chicago.CME Group Inc.

If 100% reported a deterioration, the index would be zero. If 100% of the panel saw no change, the index would be 50.0 (P2 * 0.5).an index reading of 50.0 means that the variable is unchanged, a number over 50.0 indicates an improvement, while anything below 50.0 suggests a decline.

In a price-weighted index such as the Dow Jones Industrial Average, the price of each component stock is the only consideration when determining the value of the indexThe CSI 100 Index (Chinese: 中证100指数) is a capitalization-weighted, free float adjusted stock market index designed to replicate the performance of top 100 stocks traded in the Shanghai and Shenzhen stock exchanges. It is a sub-index of CSI 300 Index.The index is compiled by the China Securities Index..A common version of capitalization weighting is the free-float weighting. With this method a float factor is assigned to each stock to account for the proportion of outstanding shares that are held by the general public, as opposed to “closely held” shares owned by the government, royalty, or company insiders (see float). For example, if for some stock 15% of shares are closely held, and the other 85% are publicly held, the float factor will be 0.85, by which the company’s market capitalization will be multiplied before weighting its value against the rest of the index. In other words, the number of shares used for calculation is the number of shares “floating”, rather than outstanding.Shares outstanding are all the shares of a corporation that have been authorized, issued and purchased by investors and are held by them. They are distinguished from treasury shares, which are shares held by the corporation itself, thus representing no exercisable rights. Shares outstanding and treasury shares together amount to the number of issued shares.The SSE Composite Index also known as SSE Index is a stock market index of all stocks (A shares and B shares) that are traded at the Shanghai Stock Exchange afjpqgIn finance, a futures contract (sometimes called futures) is a standardized legal agreement to buy or sell something at a predetermined price at a specified time in the future, between parties not known to each other E-mini S&amp;P, often abbreviated to “E-mini” (despite the existence of many other E-mini contracts) and designated by the commodity ticker symbol ES, is a stock market index futures contract traded on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange’s Globex electronic trading platform.

而文章中出现的这句The evaluation noted that the employee had frequently exhibited irresponsible behavior ( i. e. , coming to work late, failing to complete projects) ,应该用“e. g. ”而不是用“i. e.

属于阴阳合历，也就是阴历和阳历的合历，是根据月相的变化周期，每一次月相朔望变化为一个月，参考太阳回归年为一年的长度，并加入二十四节气与设置闰月以使平均历年与回归年相适应。农历融合阴历与阳历形成为一种阴阳合历历法，因使用“夏正”，古时称为夏历。 现行农历于1970年以后改称“夏历”为“农历”。由中国科学院紫金山天文台负责计算，并于公元2017年颁布了国家标准《农历的编算和颁行》。 年份分为平年和闰年，平年为十二个月，闰年为十三个月 紫金历 - 中华民国、中华人民共和国（1929年- 至今） 月应用可以反映潮汐，潮汐现象是月亮起主导作用，以月相变化为依据的阴历是古时指导海事活动指南。远洋航海、海上捕鱼、海水养殖，海洋工程及沿岸各类生产活动等都受潮汐的影响。 潮汐是指海水在天体（主要是月球和太阳）引潮力作用下所产生的周期性运动，是沿海地区的一种自然现象。在中国古代称白天的潮汐为“潮”，晚上的称为“汐”，合称为“潮汐” 在夏历每月的初一即朔点时刻处太阳和月球在地球的一侧，所以就有了最大的引潮力，所以会引起“大潮”，在夏历每月的十五或十六附近，太阳和月亮在地球的两侧，太阳和月球的引潮力你推我拉也会引起“大潮”；在月相为上弦和下弦时，即夏历的初八和二十三时，太阳引潮力和月球引潮力互相抵消了一部分所以就发生了“小潮”。 大小月月份分为大月和小月，大月三十天，小月二十九天，其平均历月等于一个朔望月。农历年中月以朔望月长度29.5306日为基础，所以大月为30日，小月为29日。为保证每月的第一天（初一）必须是朔日，就使得大小月的安排不固定，而需要通过严格的观测和计算来确定。因此，农历中连续两个月是大月或是小月的事是常有的，甚至还出现过如1990年三、四月是小月，九、十、冬、腊月连续四个月是大月的罕见特例。 朔望月朔望月，又称“太阴月”。是指月球绕地球公转相对于太阳的平均周期，为月相盈亏的平均周期。以从朔到下一次朔或从望到下一次望的时间间隔为长度，平均为29.53059天。我国的先民们把月亮圆缺的一个周期称为一个“朔望月”，把完全见不到月亮的 一天称“朔日”，定为农历的每月初一； 朔望月是指月朔到月朔，或月望到月望，或新月到新月之间周期的长度，即平均日数为29天12小时44分2.86秒。这一周期是月亮绕地球旋转；地球绕太阳旋转，三者之间相对运动而形成的，它不是月亮绕地球旋转一周的实际时间。 如果不考虑地球围绕太阳的转动，单纯计算月亮绕地球旋转一周的时间，那只是27天7小时43分11秒。这一长度叫做“恒星月”。 恒星月:由于在月亮绕地球转动过程中，途径28组恒星星座，作为月亮运行位置的记录，每组恒星各有名目，通称28宿（宫）。月亮每天运行一宿，近28天正好实际绕行地球一周. 定朔计算考虑了日月运行的不均等性，将含有真正“朔”的当天作为每月的开始。 年“岁”和“年”，在古时是有严格区别的：从立春到下一个立春，谓之一岁；从一月一日到下一个一月一日，谓之“一年”。 二十四节气廿四个节气分别为：立春、雨水、惊蛰、春分、清明、谷雨、立夏、小满、芒种、夏至、小暑、大暑、立秋、处暑、白露、秋分、寒露、霜降、立冬、小雪、大雪、冬至、小寒、大寒。 定气 计算考虑太阳在黄道上运动快慢不匀，以春分点为0度起点，太阳在黄道上每运行15度为一个“节气”，每“节气”时间不均等。两个节气之间的天数不一样、短的只有14天、长的达16天。 现行的“二十四节气”来自于三百多年前订立的“黄经度数法”（1645年起沿用至今）， “黄经度数法”是根据太阳在回归黄道上的位置来确定节气的方法，即在一个为360度圆周的“黄道”（一年当中太阳在天球上的视路径）上，划分为24等份，每15°为1等份，以春分点为0度起点（排序上仍把立春列为首位），按黄经度数编排。也就是视太阳从黄经0度出发（此刻太阳垂直照射在赤道上），每当前进15度为一个节气，运行一周又回到春分点，为一回归年。 黄道圆周360度，太阳在黄道上每运行15度为一个“节气”，每“节气”的“度数”均等、“时间”不均等。廿四个节气是24个时间点，“点”具体落在哪天，是天体运动的自然结果。“黄经度数法”划分的节气，始于立春，终于大寒。 闰月闰月（Leap Month），是历法置闰方式的一种。即阴阳历逢闰年所加的1个月。农历属阴阳历，规定不含中气的月份为闰月，并用上月的月份名称或序数称“闰某月”。 十九年七闰 平气闰月兼顾季节时令，采用十九年七闰的方法：在农历十九年中，有十二个平年，为一平年十二个月；有七个闰年，每一闰年十三个月。 计算步骤1为什么采取“十九年七闰”的方法呢? 一个朔望月平均是29.5306日，一个回归年有12.368个朔望月，0.368小数部分的渐进分数是1/2 、1/3 、3/8 、4/11 、7/19 、46/125， 即每二年加一个闰月，或每三年加一个闰月，或每八年加三个闰月……经过推算，十九年加七个闰月比较合适。因为十九个回归年=6939.6018日，而十九个农历年(加七个闰月后)共有235个朔望月，等于6939.6910日，这样二者就差不多了。 计算步骤2希望m个回归年的天数与n个朔望月的天数相等，也就是应有等式：m × 365.2422=n × 29.5306。在这个等式中，我们不能直接求出m和n，但可以求出它们的比例： 其近似值为：在这些分式中，分子表示回归年的数目，分母表示朔望月的数目。例如第六个分数式=表示19个回归年中必须加7个闰月。19个回归年中加7个闰月的结果比较：19个回归年 = 365.2422日 × 19 = 6939.6018日，235个朔望月 = 354.3672日 × 12 + 383.879日 × 7 = 6939.691日。19个回归年中加7个闰月后，矛盾消除得只差：6939.6910 - 6939.6018 = 0.0892（天）——即2小时8分多，这已经是够精确的了。 现代闰月定气闰月 （可近似看成19年7闰） 闰月特指农历每二至三年增加的一个月。为了协调回归年与农历年的矛盾，防止农历年月与回归年即四季脱节，每2~3年置1闰。 一个阴历朔望月平均为29.5306天，12个朔望月为354天或355天，与阳历回归年（约365.25天）相差11天左右，3年累计的时间差距会超过一个月。 一般来说，每过两年多（平均每30个农历月）就会有一个没有中气的月，这正好和需要加闰月的年头相符。 置闰法的规则是依据与阳历回归年相关的二十四节气来定的。一个回归年分为二十四节气，如果二十四节气从立春排到大寒，那么单数就叫做节气，双数叫中气.现行的置闰方法是两个冬至之间，如仅有12个月则不置闰，若有13个月即置闰。置闰的月从“冬至”开始，当出现第一个没有“中气”的月份，这个月就是闰月，其名称是在这个月之前月份的名称前加一个“闰”字。 中气农历用十二个中气分别表征一年的十二个月，中气与中气之间的平均相隔相较一个阴历朔望月会多出近一天。长此以往，总会出现中气在月末的现象，那么接下去的一个月必然会没有中气而只剩节气了。于是这个没有中气的农历月份就被称作上一个月的闰月。

历史上于两河流域一带人们从事游牧生活，有部分人四处宣传教义，并主要以口头传颂其所见所闻留世。 但后期人类发展出城市文明后，这些共同累积的传记、神谕等陆续被相关学者以文字记录，汇编整合为经文一体，即圣经中的旧约部分。 各大教会并开始吸收各部族信徒、与其他含多神教等争夺谁最正确无矛盾。其中以犹太教派发展最为成功，在巴勒斯坦地区中为最早称王。 信仰上，犹太教仅承认《塔纳赫》，即希伯来圣经或称希伯来手稿。 直到经过多年后出现耶稣。他将犹太教视为阶段性、任务已结束的封闭宗教，传递新约。基督教成为古犹太教的新兴教派，编辑而成新约圣经补充了神所教导耶稣的最新教义，并将一神信仰推广至外族人，在罗马帝国的帮助下欧洲成为了基督教世界。 不过也因为基督教的修正倾向，继续分裂成多个宗教教派至今。而传统上犹太教认为基督教改变了神的意思，至今不承认基督教 犹太人违背了耶和华与以色列人定的约（即旧约），所以耶和华派祂的儿子耶稣作为弥赛亚（救世主），耶稣更无私地以自己的生命为全人类赎罪，故上帝不仅与以色列人订约，而与全体人类订立“新约” 伊斯兰教 伊斯兰教与基督教一样，伊斯兰教被认为是在吸收了犹太教之后，又在基督教的经典与教义思想的基础上创立的，同样的伊斯兰教经典古兰经不被前两者承认 较广为人知的有四部：第一部叫做《讨拉特》，有指是旧约中的律法书；第二部叫做《宰蒲尔》，即旧约中的诗篇；第三部叫做《引支勒》，即新约中的福音；第四部叫做《古兰经》。 亚非语系亚非语系，又称非亚语系，全称亚细亚-阿非罗语系，旧称闪米特－含米特语系（省称闪含语系），是现今世界的主要语系之一 亚非语系旧称闪含语系或闪米特-含米特语系，是从《圣经》的传说中，诺亚的两个儿子的名字来源的，圣经说他的儿子闪是希伯来人和亚述人的祖先，另一个儿子含是非洲人的祖先 亚非语系包括六个不同的语族：柏柏尔语族、乍得语族、闪米特语族、库希特语族、奥摩语族和已灭绝的埃及语族 亚非语系中使用人数最多的语言是现代标准阿拉伯语 闪米特语族米特语族，译作闪米特语族、塞姆语族或闪米特米特语族 ，旧称叙利亚-阿拉伯语族，是亚非语系之下的语族之一，起源于中东地区，其下属语言约有3.3亿人作为母语，分布于西亚、北非和非洲之角 “闪米特”一词来源于希伯来圣经创世记，是诺亚的三个儿子之一，相传是希伯来人和亚述人的祖先 闪米特语族中使用人数最多的语言是现代标准阿拉伯语 中东其他国 与中国接壤吉尔吉斯斯坦塔吉克斯坦阿富汗巴基斯坦印度中东其他土库曼斯坦哈萨克斯坦乌兹别克斯坦 伊斯兰教 伊斯兰教（也称回教或天方教，阿拉伯语：الإسلام, al-’islām；发音：[alʔɪsˈlaːm] （关于这个音频文件 聆听）），是以《古兰经》为基础，圣训为辅助的一神教宗教，世界三大宗教之一。穆斯林（伊斯兰信徒）相信《古兰经》为造物主命天使、天神给其最后使者穆罕默德逐字逐句的启示，而圣训则是穆罕默德的言行录。伊斯兰这一名称来自《古兰经》，源自闪语字根S-L-M，意为“追随、服从（真主的律法）”；穆斯林的名字也来自这个字根，意为“追随者”、“和平与善的实践者”。 截至2020年，全球约有19亿穆斯林，占24.9%的世界人口 逊尼派是伊斯兰教最大的教派，占穆斯林总数的75%－90%。他们强调穆斯林社团的历史传统，重视《古兰经》及圣训的宗教权威。这些穆斯林大约在10世纪下半叶自称为“遵奉逊尼的人们”，以区别于其他少数派.他们相信哈里发应该选贤与能由最合资格的人出任，而不是世袭 什叶派是伊斯兰教第二大的宗派，占穆斯林总数的10－20%。什叶派穆斯林主要分布在伊朗、阿塞拜疆、伊拉克南部及南亚，他们自视为是穆斯林里的“精英” 什叶派却相信穆罕默德指定了他的女婿阿里·本·阿比·塔利卜作为他的继承人，并认为只有阿里的一些后裔才能够成为伊玛目（穆斯林的领袖），因此他们认为阿里是第一位伊玛目 和犹太人一样，同属闪族的分支。根据伊斯兰传统的说法，阿拉伯人的祖先是易斯马仪（以实玛利），而易斯马仪则是易斯哈格（以撒）的同父异母兄弟，是易卜拉欣（亚伯拉罕）的长子。因此，犹太人和阿拉伯人同是兄弟，这一对兄弟的纷争已经有一千四百余年了。 伊斯兰恐怖主义（阿拉伯语：إرهاب إسلامي，ʾirhāb ʾislāmī，英语：Islamic terrorism），或称为极端伊斯兰恐怖主义，是团体或个人的伊斯兰教性质暴力恐怖主义，动机多是以《古兰经》的经文或源自圣训的教诲为名目。伊斯兰恐怖主义分子借鉴于古兰经的经文和圣训，把政治性质的暴力行为合理化。 什叶派 真主党 胡塞运动逊尼派 基地组织 塔利班 大部分穆斯林都在亚洲和非洲。全球约62%的穆斯林都在亚洲生活，超过6.82亿人分布在印度次大陆的三个国家（孟加拉、印度、巴基斯坦）及印尼，在西亚，非阿拉伯的土耳其及伊朗是最大的穆斯林占多数的国家。尼日利亚是非洲最大的穆斯林国家，他们的穆斯林人口超过任何一个阿拉伯国家，包括埃及 瓦哈比教派近代伊斯兰教复古主义派别。亦称瓦哈比派运动。18世纪中叶，由阿拉伯半岛纳季德地区的伊斯兰学者穆罕默德·伊本·阿卜杜勒·瓦哈卜(1703-1792)创立。该派自称“认主独一者”。 阿拉伯人/语在伊斯兰教中所谓的蒙昧时代，只有阿拉比亚的游牧民族贝都因人被称为阿拉伯人。 大扩张之后倭马亚王朝建立，只有源出阿拉伯半岛、血统纯正的人才有资格自称阿拉伯人，拥有高贵的身份； 而到了阿拔斯王朝，文明的融合进一步加强。阿拉伯人这个概念，逐渐包括了帝国属下所有使用阿拉伯语、信仰伊斯兰的各族人民。 阿拉伯语 阿拉伯语源自古语言闪米特语，源于叙利亚沙漠 [7]，于5世纪时在北方方言基础上形成统一的文学语言[7]，从公元6世纪开始便有古阿拉伯语的文献，公元7世纪开始，伴随着阿拉伯帝国的扩张，阿拉伯语完全取代了伊拉克、叙利亚、埃及和北非从前使用的语言。 4.阿拉伯帝国 （610年－1258年）阿拉伯帝国（632年－1258年），是阿拉伯半岛上的阿拉伯人于中世纪创建的统治伊斯兰教穆斯林，由哈里发统治的帝国（本意为“哈里发的领地”）。 倭马亚王朝的最大疆域 穆斯林认为是在公元610年开始，伊斯兰教先知穆罕默德开始奉真主之命而在麦加传播伊斯兰教。阿拉伯半岛上的各部落民众开始以伊斯兰教为核心建立一个统一的阿拉伯穆斯林国家。 阿拉伯世界（阿拉伯语：الوطن العربي）是指分布于西亚和北非，以阿拉伯语为主要语言，以伊斯兰教为主要信仰的国家和地区。阿拉伯世界人口总和4.23亿人，主要为阿拉伯民族。 阿拉伯半岛(/əˈreɪbiə/;)位于西亚，其西边和非洲接壤，它从中东向东南方伸入印度洋。面积3,237,500 km2，是世界上最大的半岛 沙特阿拉伯、也门、阿曼、阿拉伯联合酋长国位于阿拉伯半岛上。其中以沙特阿拉伯的面积最大，占据大部分的阿拉伯半岛。 阿拉伯半岛是伊斯兰教的诞生地。伊斯兰教的创教人穆罕默德在这里出生和生活。半岛上的麦加是伊斯兰教的圣地。以阿拉伯半岛为中心的阿拉伯帝国曾横跨欧亚非大陆。今天半岛上所有国家都以伊斯兰教为国教，并以逊尼派占多数。 阿拉伯海（阿拉伯语：بحر العرب）为印度洋的一部分。位于亚洲南部的阿拉伯半岛同印度半岛之间。北部为波斯湾和阿曼湾，西部经亚丁湾通红海。 阿拉伯之春在各地形势图： 政府被数次推翻 政府被推翻 爆发内战 爆发抗议活动以致政府改组 爆发大型抗议活动 爆发小型局部抗议活动 阿拉伯世界之外的军事行动和抗议活动 阿拉伯之春，又称“阿拉伯的觉醒”、“阿拉伯起义”，是指自2010年年底在北非和西亚的阿拉伯国家和其它地区的一些国家发生的一系列以“民主”和“经济”等为主题的社会运动，这些运动多采取公开示威游行和网络串连的方式，其影响之深、范围之广使全世界十分关注。从2011年初开始，其带来的影响与后续效应至今尚未完全结束。 造成这些动荡的主要原因包括：世界油价逐渐下跌导致阿拉伯地区依赖石油出口的国家的经济衰退、失业率居高不下、政府贪污腐败、人民生活贫困、专制统治、政治体制僵化、人权的侵犯；领导人长期执政，不思改革，政治经济分配不透明等等。 2008全球金融危机加剧了阿拉伯世界的经济困难，推动了革命运动的爆发 阿拉伯革命已经成功推翻了6个国家政权。2011年1月14日晚，突尼斯革命的局势恶化导致已执政23年的总统本·阿里下台并流亡沙特阿拉伯。埃及示威浪潮使总统穆巴拉克在2011年2月11日正式宣布下台，权力移交军方，结束长达30年统治。利比亚反对派成立全国过渡委员会，成功推翻卡扎菲长达42年的统治，卡扎菲本人于2011年10月20日被杀害。2012年2月27日，也门政治协议正式生效，已执政33年的总统萨利赫退位，萨利赫本人于2017年12月4日被杀害。2019年4月2日，阿尔及利亚总统布特弗利卡正式辞职，结束了近20年的总统生涯。2019年4月11日，掌权长达30年的苏丹总统巴希尔被军事政变推翻。

迦南人，巴勒斯坦的早期居民，讲闪语族语言，属于闪米特民族的一支。血缘上与阿拉伯人和犹太人相近，在新石器时代由当地人与东方移民混血所产生。他们曾经击败希伯来人（犹太人）对巴勒斯坦的入侵，但后来最终被希伯来人统治。随后融入其他闪米特民族。现代90%黎巴嫩人的DNA来自迦南人。 1988年11月15日，在阿尔及利亚首都阿尔及尔举行的巴勒斯坦全国委员会第19次特别会议通过《独立宣言》，巴勒斯坦解放组织宣布在巴勒斯坦土地上建立首都为耶路撒冷的巴勒斯坦国。 2007年6月因内部两大势力严重不和而形成分裂局面，其中巴勒斯坦伊斯兰抵抗运动（即“哈马斯”）占有加沙地带，而巴勒斯坦民族解放运动（即“法塔赫”）主导的巴勒斯坦自治政府则管治约旦河西岸，受巴勒斯坦民族权力机构监督。 巴勒斯坦国现由巴勒斯坦解放组织正式管理，并宣称拥有西岸和加沙地带；然而，这两个地区自1948年便分别由约旦和埃及占领，自1967年六日战争以来则由以色列占领 巴勒斯坦至今未能正式立国，以巴冲突仍在延续。 黎巴嫩 黎巴嫩共和国（阿拉伯语：لبنان；亚拉姆语：ܠܒܢܢ, 法语：Liban）通称黎巴嫩，位于亚洲西南部（西亚）、地中海东岸，习惯上归属于中东国家。东北部与叙利亚接壤，南部与以色列和巴勒斯坦为邻，西濒地中海。黎巴嫩历史上与基督教关系密切，是中东地区为数不多的共和国和西化的国家之一。 1920年，国联将叙利亚、黎巴嫩委托法国统治，两国分别于1941年和1943年独立。叙利亚不承认黎巴嫩的独立，视其为叙利亚的属地。 1975年，黎巴嫩内乱为本国穆斯林和巴勒斯坦人一方，基督徒为另一方的战争 2005年2月，黎前总理哈里里遇害，叙迫于国际压力，结束了在黎29年的驻军。 尽管黎巴嫩基督徒的大量迁出导致其在该国的多数族裔地位逐步消退，这一群体在今天仍旧代表着黎巴嫩最大的宗教派别之一 约旦叙利亚伊拉克 伊朗和伊拉克都为伊斯兰国家，信奉伊斯兰教。伊朗的伊斯兰教徒以什叶派为主，伊拉克虽然也是什叶派穆斯林占多数，但掌握国家政权的却是逊尼派。 历史上，伊拉克为什叶派发源地，掌握了国家政权的伊朗什叶派不满伊拉克逊尼派大权在握，同样令他们不满意的还有伊拉克并非一个政教合一的国家 伊朗人口主要由波斯人组成，而伊拉克及大多数阿拉伯国家为阿拉伯人占多数。 美索不达米亚 美索不达米亚（亚拉姆语：ܒܝܬ ܢܗܪܝܢ，希腊语：Μεσοποταμία，）是古希腊对两河流域的称谓，μεσο意为中间，ποταμία为古希腊文中河流（阿拉伯语：بِلَاد ٱلرَّافِدَيْن）之意，转化成“（两条）河流中间的地方”。这两条河指的是幼发拉底河和底格里斯河，在两河之间的美索不达米亚平原上产生和发展的古文明称为两河文明或美索不达米亚文明，它大体位于现今的伊拉克，其存在时间从公元前4000年到公元前2世纪，是人类最早的文明。 其西边是叙利亚沙漠，北部是土耳其的托罗斯山脉，东部是伊朗的扎格罗斯山脉，南边滨临波斯湾。幼发拉底河和底格里斯河发源于土耳其东部的山脉和高地，随后几乎平行地向南流入波斯湾，沿两岸形成的冲积平原就是美索不达米亚。 楔形文字 起源和发展于美索不达米亚的文字，由于其外形有些像钉子或楔子，所以被称为楔形文字 新苏美尔时期 前2193年－前2004年 古巴比伦 亚述 前2004年－前605年 新巴比伦 迦勒底人 前605年－前539年 巴比伦文明大致以今天的巴格达城为界，分为南北两部分。北部以古亚述城为中心，称为亚述利亚，或简称亚述；南部以巴比伦城（今巴比伦省希拉市东北郊）为中心，称为巴比伦尼亚，意思为“巴比伦的国土”。巴比伦尼亚又分为两个地区，南部靠近波斯湾口的地区为苏美尔，苏美尔以北地区为阿卡德，美索不达米亚文明最初就是由苏美尔人创造出来的。 科威特埃及古埃及古埃及（阿拉伯语：مصر القديمة）是位于非洲东北部尼罗河中下游地区的古代文明，开始于公元前32世纪左右时美尼斯统一上下埃及建立第一王朝，终止于公元前343年波斯再次征服埃及。 埃及学家一般将古埃及历史和历代法老王朝分为前王朝时期（公元前31世纪之前）、早王朝时期（约公元前3100年—公元前2686年）， 公元前3188年左右，传说上埃及国王美尼斯统一上、下埃及，建立第一王朝，定都孟斐斯（今吉萨省拜德尔舍因（Al Badrashin）拉希纳村（Mit Rahina），孟菲斯并不位于开罗，开罗应位于另一个古城赫利奥波利斯），成为古埃及第一个法老，古埃及从此开始王朝时期。 古王国时期（约公元前2686年—公元前2181年），第一中间期（约公元前2181年—公元前2040年），中王国时期（约公元前2040年—公元前1786年），第二中间期（约公元前1786年—公元前1567年），新王国时期（约公元前1567年—公元前1085年），第三中间期（约公元前1085年—公元前667年），后王朝时期（约公元前667年—公元前332年）， 波斯统治在公元前525年被波斯阿契美尼德帝国所灭，古埃及时代结束。 希腊罗马化埃及 托勒密王朝公元前332年埃及又被亚历山大大帝所统治，亚历山大死后，其部将托勒密占领埃及，建立托勒密王朝，也被称为法老 罗马帝国统治时期随后，古罗马崛起，成为地中海世界大国，埃及也被其占领。 罗马帝国之后公元7世纪，阿拉伯人再次入侵埃及，古埃及原有的文明在这一过程中被阿拉伯文明所取代，而逐渐消失。 1517年，埃及开始受奥斯曼帝国统治，1798年－1801年受法国统治，1801年后英国势力侵入。埃及最终在1922年取得独立，1953年建立共和国，但它已经是一个阿拉伯国家了。 沙特阿拉伯沙特半岛其他巴林卡塔尔阿拉伯联合酋长国阿曼也门 希伯来语希伯来人的名称源自希伯(Eber)。根据《创世记》第10章第22-24节，希伯是挪亚的玄孙、闪的曾孙、亚法撒的孙子 希伯来语（עִבְרִית ‘Ivrit，读音：[iv’ri:t]），属于亚非语系闪米特语族，为古代犹太民族（以色列民族或希伯来民族）一直到现代人民的民族语言、也是基督教和犹太教的宗教语言。过去2500年，希伯来语主要用于《圣经》与相关宗教方面的研究，自从20世纪特别是以色列复国以来，希伯来语作为口语在犹太人中复活 以色列 希伯来人在过去3000年的历史中，犹太人视以色列地为自己的民族和精神生活的核心，称之为“圣地”或“应许之地”。 前12世纪，犹太人的祖先希伯来部落迁此，于前11世纪建立王国，之后一直受古埃及统治直到公元前10世纪撤出巴勒斯坦地区。 大卫王与所罗门王 自19世纪末锡安主义兴起后，1917年英国政府发布贝尔福宣言表态支持犹太复国运动，在巴勒斯坦也掀起数波犹太人回归运动，使得当地犹太人比率不断升高。然而因犹太人离去已约2000年，长久以来早已成为阿拉伯人的传统领域，此种“回归”事实上也对当地阿拉伯居民造成严重伤害，认为犹太人侵略他们居住数千年的土地，因而以阿冲突事件的升高也与犹太人的数量成正比。 1947年，犹太人与阿拉伯人两者之间的冲突不断升级、批评声浪增加，犹太人宣布将于1948年5月14日建立以色列国，英国政府则决定自1948年5月15日起切割其作为巴勒斯坦托管者的身份 1947年11月，联合国大会表决《1947年联合国分治方案》。将巴勒斯坦托管地（约旦河以西[注 2]）再分为两个国家，由犹太人与阿拉伯人分治，划为多块交错的领土，两国领土面积分别占大约55%及45%；至于耶路撒冷则被置于联合国的管理之下，以免双方发生冲突。《1947年联合国分治方案》，蓝色：犹太国家（即以色列）橙色：阿拉伯国家（即巴勒斯坦） 1948年5月14日，在英国的托管期结束前一天，以色列国正式宣布成立。 约旦则占有东耶路撒冷、以色列南部一块山地区域和撒马利亚，后来那里被称为西岸地区；埃及在沿海地区占有一小块的土地，后来被称为加沙地带。 以色列建国时首都在特拉维夫，1950年迁往耶路撒冷，但未获国际社会普遍承认。1980年7月30日，以色列议会通过法案，宣布“完整和统一的耶路撒冷是以色列的首都” 以色列行政区划包括以下六个行政区（括号内为首府）： 1 北部区（拿撒勒）2 海法区（海法）3 中央区（拉姆拉）4 特拉维夫区（特拉维夫）5 耶路撒冷区（耶路撒冷）6 南部区（贝尔谢巴）另外，以色列还有以下三个争议地区（括号内为争议地区所属的以色列行政区划）： A 戈兰高地 （北部区，原叙利亚领土，现由以色列管辖）B 约旦河西岸 （犹大-撒马利亚区，原约旦领土，现部分由巴勒斯坦民族权力机构实际管辖）C 加沙地带 （加沙区，现由巴勒斯坦民族权力机构管辖） 阿尔泰语系主要将突厥语族、蒙古语族和通古斯语族划为一个语系 突厥语族 早期的突厥人起源于东北亚，然后向西迁移。他们在基因上与其他东亚族群密切相关。 突厥语民族，即广义的突厥人（土耳其语：Türk / Türkler），是欧亚大陆使用突厥语族语言的众多族群的统称，源自原始突厥族 突厥汗国（突厥语： türk），又称突厥第一汗国，为原先在柔然统治下的阿史那氏部族，连合使用古突厥语的各游牧部落，于552年在今蒙古国地区建立了由古突厥民族组成的古代帝国，并一度控制漠北、中亚等柔然故地。 以突厥语为官方语言或主要语言的国家和地区。 土耳其土耳其共和国（土耳其语：Türkiye Cumhuriyeti），通称土耳其（土耳其语：Türkiye），是横跨欧亚两洲的国家，其国土包括西亚安纳托利亚半岛、以及巴尔干半岛的东色雷斯地区；其中亚洲部分包含了约97%的领土与87%的人口[5]。北临黑海，南临地中海，东南与叙利亚、伊拉克接壤，西临爱琴海，并与希腊以及保加利亚接壤，东部与格鲁吉亚、亚美尼亚、阿塞拜疆、伊朗接壤。 土耳其这个国名在土耳其语中为“Türkiye”，该词汇来源于奥斯曼土耳其语，意为“突厥人的土地”。 在英语中，土耳其长期被称为“Turkey” 因为“Turkey”一词的含义后来在英语中有“火鸡”、“愚蠢的人”、“失败”等负面的意思，所以有很多土耳其人认为这损害了国家声誉。2021年12月，土耳其总统雷杰普·塔伊普·埃尔多安下令避免使用“Turkey”、“Turkei”、“Turquie”等敏感词汇，将出口产品上“Made in Turkey”的英文标签改为“Made in Türkiye” 古安纳托利亚人自新石器时代起即于此生活，直至亚历山大大帝征服此地[17]。这些民族普遍使用安那托利亚语言（印欧语系的分支之一） 塞尔柱王朝为乌古斯突厥人的一支，9世纪时定居于穆斯林世界边缘的乌古斯叶护国，里海与咸海以北[38]。10世纪时，塞尔柱人由其发源地迁徙至波斯，这一地区也成为大塞尔柱帝国的行政中心 1071年，塞尔柱帝国于曼齐刻尔特战役中击败拜占庭帝国，由此这一区域的突厥化进程开始，土耳其语和伊斯兰教得到传播，安纳托利亚也逐渐由基督教希腊语地区转变为穆斯林土耳其语地区 2016年，伊斯兰教是土耳其的主要宗教，占总人口83％ 现代土耳其人是乌古斯突厥的一部，他们认为突厥的历史可以追溯到公元48年立国的北匈奴。但实际上，历经长期的迁徙和混血，土耳其人和原突厥人在血统和相貌上都相去甚远。土耳其人今天的血统为白种人血统，主要以东伊朗人（东波斯人）和希腊人为主。 Anatolia一般指小亚细亚半岛 小亚细亚半岛(Asia Minor Peninsula)，又称安纳托利亚半岛，亚洲西部的半岛，位于土耳其境内 5.奥斯曼帝国 奥斯曼帝国（英文：Ottoman Empire；1299年 —1923年 ），是土耳其人建立的多民族帝国，因创立者为奥斯曼一世而得名。统治者为起源于中亚突厥游牧部落的奥斯曼人 继承了东罗马帝国的基督教文化及伊斯兰文化，因而东西文明在其得以统合 其后第一次世界大战败于协约国之手，奥斯曼帝国因而分裂。 土耳其语（Türkçe；[ˈtyɾctʃe] （关于这个音频文件 聆听） ），是一种现有7300万到8700万人使用的语言，属突厥语族，主要在土耳其本土使用 土耳其语是突厥语族诸语中使用人数最多的语言。 高加索格鲁吉亚阿塞拜疆亚美尼亚 pavonis孔雀座 现行的国际通用星座划分方式确立于1930年，国际天文联合会在古希腊星座的基础上通过边界划分确立了88个星座区。 按照天球位置进行天区分类，这88个星座可以被分为29个北天星座、12个黄道星座、47个南天星座。 按照星座家族划分方式，又可归类出8个星座家族:大熊家族、黄道家族、英仙家族、武仙家族、猎户家族、幻之水族家族、拜耳家族、拉卡伊家族。 黄道星座家族(黄道上的13个星座): 白羊座、金牛座、双子座、巨蟹座、狮子座、室女座、天秤座、天蝎座、蛇夫座、射手座、摩羯座、水瓶座、双鱼座。(注:属于南天星座的蛇夫座虽然并非黄道星座，但也被黄道带所穿过，属于黄道星座家族) 印欧语系 印欧语系（英语：Indo-European languages），全称印度—欧罗巴语系，是世界上分布最广泛的语系。欧洲、南亚、美洲和大洋洲的大部分国家都采用印欧语系的语言作为母语或官方语言。印欧语系包括443种（SIL统计）语言和方言，母语使用人口有约32亿。 日耳曼语族 西日耳曼语支 盎格鲁-弗里西语 -&gt; 英语 古高地德语 -&gt; 德语 低地法兰克语 -&gt; 荷兰语 -&gt;

雅利安人（英语：Aryan）一般指印度西北部的一支族群。现在“雅利安”几乎仅用于语言学术语印度-雅利安语支中，“雅利安人”就是讲这个语支的语言的人，主要指印度-雅利安人。 在十九世纪，由于对于梵文佛经的误解，一些西方学者产生了种族主义的观念：认为一支金发且肤色白皙的北欧“雅利安人”从北欧出发，征服了世界各处，而创始了各大文明。在此之后，他们和各地当地人种通婚混血，而变得不纯正。 二十世纪初，纳粹德国把优等民族（Herrenrasse）称为雅利安人。他们认为德国人是血统最纯正的北欧民族之一，而对其它种族（尤其是犹太人和吉普赛人）施行歧视、征服和灭绝策略。 吠陀梵语 -&gt; 梵语 西部印地语 -&gt; 印度斯坦语 -&gt; 印地语hindi 凯尔特语族 爱尔兰语 威尔士语 Latin (lingua Latīna [ˈlɪŋɡʷa ɫaˈtiːna] or Latīnum [ɫaˈtiːnʊ̃]) is a classical language belonging to the Italic branch of the Indo-European languages. through the power of the Roman Republic it became the dominant language in the Italian region and subsequently throughout the Roman Empire. 俄罗斯 印度-伊朗语族印度 伊朗 波斯 波斯（拉丁语：Persia）是伊朗在欧洲的古希腊语和拉丁语的旧称译音，是伊朗历史的一部分。 自公元前600年开始，希腊人把这一地区叫作“波斯” 波斯人则从萨珊王朝时期起开始称呼自己的国家为埃兰沙赫尔（Erânshahr or Iranshahr），意为“中古雅利安人帝国”。 1935年，波斯国王礼萨·汗宣布国际上该国应被称作“伊朗”，但“波斯”一词在这之后还有人使用。 在中文里，“波斯”被用于描述1935年之前的伊朗，或该民族从古就有的事物，如波斯语和波斯地毯。现代政治、经济等事物则用“伊朗”一词。其实根据考据，艾兰（Eran）、雅利安（Aryan）、伊朗（Iran）皆是同词音转，具有同源关系，皆为伊朗本身的名字。 伊朗是一个由什叶派主导的伊斯兰共和制国家。伊斯兰教在伊朗拥有至高无上的道德权威，是公共生活的最高准则。 埃兰和米底时期（前2700年－前553年） 中古与近代时期 637年，阿拉伯帝国的穆斯林军在卡迪西亚战役打败波斯萨珊王朝的军队，攻占其首都泰西封，开始了伊斯兰对波斯的征服，同时也终结了波斯地区的琐罗亚斯德教文化。 safavid empire萨法维王朝 萨法维王朝（波斯文：سلسلهٔ صفويان，英文：Safavid dynasty；1501年－1736年） 巴列维王朝时期 1921年2月21日，礼萨·汗上校发动军事政变，占据德黑兰，1925年取得王位，建立巴列维王朝，于1935年改国名为伊朗。美国为了获得伊朗的石油及保持在中东的利益，大力扶持巴列维王朝，伊朗强大的军力俨然成为波斯湾地区的警察。 伊斯兰共和国时期 伊朗伊斯兰革命 1979年4月1日霍梅尼宣布改国名为伊朗伊斯兰共和国，举行公民投票，建立了政教合一的制度。 两伊战争 1.波斯帝国 （前2700年－前553年） 阿契美尼德王朝（古波斯语：𐎧𐏁𐏂，罗马化：Xšāça，直译：帝国），也称波斯帝国或波斯第一帝国，《圣经》中称为玛代波斯/波斯米底亚，是古代波斯地区第一个把领土扩张到大部分中亚和西亚领域的王朝，也是第一个横跨欧亚非三洲的帝国。 阿契美尼德一词的意思是“阿契美尼斯家族中的一员”。阿契美尼斯（古波斯语：𐏃𐎧𐎠𐎶𐎴𐎡𐏁 āHaxāmaniš；[20]） 是bahuvrihi复合词，意为“了解朋友的思想” 阿富汗 阿富汗（普什图语和达利语：افغانستان）是位于亚洲中南部的内陆国家 阿富汗民主共和国建立1978年4月30日1979年苏联军队入侵，处决了阿富汗人民民主党总书记哈菲佐拉·阿明。苏联扶植的阿富汗民主共和国 阿富汗伊斯兰国建立1992年4月28日推翻了苏联扶植的阿富汗民主共和国的圣战者们，建立了阿富汗伊斯兰国 阿富汗伊斯兰酋长国建立1996年9月7日发源于阿富汗坎大哈地区的伊斯兰原教旨主义运动组织-塔利班，于1994年兴起，逐渐发展具有政治与宗教武力的团体，最终在1996年攻陷喀布尔获取政权，得以占领90%的国土，1997年10月改国名为“阿富汗伊斯兰酋长国” 阿富汗伊斯兰共和国建立2004年1月26日 美国与其盟友随着2001年发生的911事件后发起阿富汗战争以及同时支持反对塔利班的北方联盟让塔利班酋长国政权瓦解。2004年1月26日，美国扶持的阿富汗伊斯兰共和国成立。2021年8月美军宣布撤出阿富汗后，塔利班迅速击溃政府军占领绝大多数阿富汗领土 阿富汗伊斯兰酋长国重建2021年8月19日2021年8月19日下午，塔利班取得胜利后，正式宣布重建“阿富汗伊斯兰酋长国” 基督教 Catholc Protestant新教教徒（16世纪脱离罗马天主教）a member of a part of the Western Christian Church that separated from the Roman Catholic Church in

罗马自公元前三世纪已经开始并吞行省；四个世纪后,罗马的领土范围已经达到前所未有地辽阔。 罗马帝国可分为前期（前27年—200年）、中期（200年—395年）和后期〔395年—1204年[注 2]/1453年[注 3]〕三个阶段。 西罗马帝国在476年灭亡后，东部帝国（亦称拜占庭帝国）延续到1453年被奥斯曼人攻陷君士坦丁堡为止。 4.东罗马帝国 〔395年—1204年/1453年〕 东罗马帝国是罗马帝国于公元286年实行东西分治后，于原帝国东部（相对于西部的西罗马帝国）分离出的政权；其被当时的西欧世界视为有别于古罗马的新政权，故其灭亡后西欧学界普遍称之为拜占庭帝国。然而其国祚一千余年期间仍自称罗马帝国 拜占庭（希腊语：Βυζάντιον，拉丁语：Byzantium）是一个古希腊城市，也为现今土耳其伊斯坦布尔（君士坦丁堡）的旧名，相传是从墨伽拉来的殖民于公元前667年建立的。拜占庭的名字据说出自他们的王“拜占斯（Βύζας或Βύζαντας）”，直至4世纪中期，该城发展成东罗马帝国（即拜占庭帝国）的中心，更名为君士坦丁堡 法兰克王国 481年 - 843年 法兰克王国（拉丁语：Regnum Francorum，法语：Royaumes francs，德语：Fränkisches Reich），指的是一个5世纪至9世纪间存在于欧洲中欧和西欧的王国 拿破仑帝国 希腊语族希腊希腊共和国在欧洲的位置 希腊共和国在世界上的位置 古希腊 古希腊（希腊语：Ελλάς，罗马化：Ellas）是希腊的一个历史时期，狭义上指希腊地区从公元前12世纪迈锡尼文明毁灭至公元前146年希腊地区被罗马共和国征服为止。广义上指爱琴诸文明在罗马人征服前的全部历史。 青铜时代早在约公元前3650年，爱琴海地区就孕育了灿烂的米诺斯文明（或称克里特文明）， 约公元前16世纪被迈锡尼文明取代，文明中心从克里特岛转向了希腊大陆。 黑暗时代约公元前1200年，多利安人入侵毁灭了迈锡尼文明，希腊历史进入所谓“黑暗时代”或“中古希腊”。 古风时代在公元前九世纪末期，海上贸易再次兴盛，新的城邦国家纷纷建立。 古典时代公元前5世纪初在雅典与斯巴达领导下，希腊城邦联军在两次波希战争战胜波斯帝国。此时希腊文明进入了最高峰，古典哲学，科技，艺术以及民主政治快速发展，获称为“黄金时期”（伯里克利在位）。 伯罗奔尼撒战争结束了雅典民主制，希腊各城邦进入混战。 希腊化时代 公元前4世纪末马其顿国王亚历山大大帝征服希腊地区后，古希腊文化播迁到埃及与印度河流域的广大地区，称为希腊化时期。 2.马其顿王国 （前808年 - 前168年） 马其顿王国（古希腊语：Μακεδονία）是古希腊西北部王国。其史上最辉煌的时期即为亚历山大大帝开创的亚历山大帝国。 亚历山大帝国是历史上继波斯帝国之后第二个地跨欧、亚、非三洲的帝国 前808年卡拉努斯建立阿吉德王朝 前168年第三次马其顿战争战败，被罗马共和国吞并 Aegaeus爱琴海的位置 爱琴海（希腊语：Αιγαίο Πέλαγος；土耳其语：Ege Denizi，或Adalar Deniz）是欧洲与亚洲之间的一个细长陆缘海，位于巴尔干半岛与安纳托利亚之间 爱琴海北侧经达达尼尔海峡、博斯海峽与黑海相连，南侧接地中海。 缘海、陆陆缘海或称边陆缘海（英语：Marginal Sea）指的是大海的四周大部分是由半岛、岛屿或者陆地所环绕的大海；名称差异为陆缘海是地球科学名词，陆陆缘海是地质学名词，边陆缘海是海洋学名词，英文名称都是Marginal Sea 与内海、海湾差异：目前对于内海与边陆缘海的定义都不明确，同一个区域海域对于某一广大海域为边陆缘海，但该区域海域靠近某个单一国家的海域，对该国家来说又可以是一个内海或海湾，并没有明确定义区分此差异。 Austro-Hungariian Empire 奥斯特罗·匈牙利 奥匈帝国奥地利帝国（德语：Kaisertum Österreich、英语：Austrian Empire，1804年-1918年）1156年，神圣罗马帝国皇帝腓特烈一世在位期间，对帝国内部的大国进行了拆解，其中对巴伐利亚的拆解使用了小特权方案，奥地利由边区提升为公国，正式建国。 German Confederation匈牙利 HUNGARY马扎尔人（匈牙利语：magyarok），也可写为马札儿人，由于是匈牙利的主体民族（2016年人口为1200万-1400万），故又称匈牙利人，母语属于乌拉尔语系 欧洲近现代1500年 1880年 World War I World War II EU 亚洲 牧民pastoral people蒙古人 mongol 1200-1500成吉思汗 非洲摩洛哥 Morocco美洲美洲原住民在15世纪末之前本来并没有统一的称法。1492年意大利航海家克里斯托弗·哥伦布航行至美洲时，误以为所到之处为印度，因此将此地的原住民称作“印度人”（西班牙语：“indios”），后人虽然发现了错误，但是原有称呼已经普及，所以英语和其他欧洲语言中称印第安人为“西印度人”，在必要时为了区别，称真正的印度人为“东印度人”。汉语翻译时直接把“西印度人”这个单词翻译成“印第安人”或“印地安人”，免去了混淆的麻烦，到目前仍为最普及的用法。","link":"/lucfe-hexo/0003%20Natural%20science/%E5%9C%B0%E7%90%83%E7%A7%91%E5%AD%A6%20Earth%20science/%E5%9C%B0%E7%90%86wiki/"},{"title":"","text":"THE

RADIATIONThe transmission of energy in the form of waves through an object. When a human, or animal, undergoes an X-ray, the image taken of their body reveals the structures that absorbed the most radiation.In the picture, bones appear white because the calcium in them absorbs the most radiation.Everything else in the body absorbs less radiation, causing the color of the organs to look gray or black. MAGNETIC RESONANCE IMAGING SCANS (MRIs)MRIs use a magnet and radio waves to produce detailed images of internal organs and muscles that might not show up in an X-ray.(medical 医) 磁共振成像a method of using a strong magnetic field to produce an image of the inside of a person’s body resonance共振；谐振the sound or other vibration produced in an object by sound or vibrations of a similar frequency from another object Chapter 2: CRITICAL THINKING IN BIOLOGYChapter 3: CHARACTERISTICS OF LIFE They are made of one or more CELLS, The basic units of life. They need energy to live. They respond to STIMULI((使生物产生反应的)刺激Anything that causes a response)–they react to their enviroment(for instance,light,temperature,and touch) LIFE FUNCTIONSAll ORGANISMS (living things) must have the potential to carry out certain behaviors, known as LIFE FUNCTIONS .Life functions are processes that an organism takes on to help it survive. The life functions are: Growth: an increase in the number of cellsAs more cells are made, the organism goes through the process of growth.The growth in cells helps them live better in their environment. Reproduction: the creation of a new organism with its own cells.The new organism is referred to as OFFSPRING(后代).Some offspring are born looking like their parents (for example, human babies);other offspring are born in one form and then change as they grow to another (like tadpoles蝌蚪 changing into frogs). Reproduction can happen with either one- or two-parent organisms. When one parent organism reproduces by itself, the process is called ASEXUAL REPRODUCTION. The offspring looks like the parent. Bacteria usually reproduce asexually. When two parents reproduce, it ’s called SEXUAL REPRODUCTION. Many plants and animals are sexual reproducers. Nutrition营养的补给: the taking in of food(nutrients: Any substance that promotes life and provides energy. All living things need NUTRIENTS to survive. Nutrients keep an organism healthy.) Organisms can be categorized according to how they get their nutrition: AUTOTROPHS , organisms that can make their own food, such as plants. HETEROTROPHS , organisms that cannot make their own food, such as animals. Auto comes from the Greek word autos, meaning “self.” hetero prefix: hetero-异质的;不同的;other; different. heterosexual: sexually or romantically attracted exclusively to people of the other sex. trophThe meaning of TROPH- is nutritive. respiration: the breakdown of nutrients to get energy respiration呼吸the act of breathingthe metabolic processes whereby certain organisms obtain energy from organic molecules metabolic metabolism新陈代谢the chemical processes in living things that change food, etc. into energy and materials for growth UNIT 2: The Chemistry of LifeUNIT 3: Cell TheoryUNIT 4: Bacteria, Viruses, Prions, and ViroidsBacteria细菌bacterium的复数the simplest and smallest forms of life.

Thenumber is the concept represented by the numeral, and therefore consists of a whole networkof connections between symbols, pictures, language and real-life situations. The same number (for example, the one we call ‘three hundred and sixty-six’) can be represented by different numerals – such as 366 in our Hindu-Arabic, place-value system, and CCCLXVI usingRoman numerals Because the Hindu-Arabic system of numeration is now more or less universal, the distinction between the numeral and the number is easily lost. What are the cardinal and ordinal aspects of number? cardinal基数；a number, such as 1, 2 and 3, used to show quantity rather than order ordinal序数词（如第一、第二等）a number that refers to the position of sth in a series, for example ‘first’, ‘second’, etc. s an adjective describing a small setof objects: two brothers, three sweets, five fingers, three blocks, and so on. This idea of a numberbeing a description of a set of things is called the cardinal aspect of number. numbers usedas labels to put things in order. For example, theyturn to page 3 in a book.The numerals and words being used here do not representcardinal numbers, because they are not referring to sets of three things.In these examples, ‘three’ is one thing, which is labelled three because of theposition in which it lies in some ordering process. This is called the ordinal aspect of number. The most important experience of the ordinal aspect of number is whenwe represent numbers as locations on a number strip or as points ona number line There is a further way in which numerals are used,sometimes called the nominal aspect. This is wherethe numeral is used as a label or a name, without anyordering implied. The usual example to give herewould be a number 7 bus. What are natural numbers and integers?use forcounting: {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, …}, going on forever.These are what mathematicians choose to call the setof natural numbers the set of integers: {…, –5, –4, –3, –2, –1, 0, 1,2, 3, 4, 5, …} now going on forever in both directions.includes both positive integers (whole numbers greater than zero) and negative integers (wholenumbers less than zero), and zero itself. The integer –4 is properly named ‘negative four’, the integer +4 is named ‘positive four’, natural numbers are positive integers. What are rational and real numbers? include fractions and decimalnumbers (which, as we shall see, are a particular kind of(是一种特殊的) fraction), we get the set ofrational numbers. The term ‘rational’ derives from the idea that a fraction represents a ratio. The technicaldefinition of a rational number is any number that is the ratio of two integers. Rational numbers enable us to subdivide thesections of the number line between the integers and to label the points in between, there are other real numbers that cannot be written down as exact fractions or decimals – and are therefore not rational. there is no fraction or decimal that is exactly equal to the square root of 50 (written as √50).This means there is no rational number that when multiplied by itself gives exactly the answer50. – we could never get a numberthat gave us 50 exactly when we squared it. But √50 is a real number – in the sense that itrepresents a real point on a continuous number line, somewhere between 7 and 8. It representsa real length. So this is a real length, a real number, butit is not a rational number. It is called an irrational number.利用勾股定理得到平方根数的实际长度 theset of real numbers includes all rational numbers – which include integers, which in turninclude natural numbers – and all irrational numbers. What is meant by ‘place value’?in the Hindu-Arabic systemwe do not use a symbol representing a hundred toconstruct three hundreds: we use a symbol representing three! Just this one symbol is needed to representthree hundreds, and we know that it represents threehundreds, rather than three tens or three ones, becauseof the place in which it is written. in our Hindu-Arabic place-value system, allnumbers can be represented using a finite set of digits,namely, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9. Like most numeration systems, no doubt because of the availability ofour ten fingers for counting purposes, the system usesten as a base. Larger whole numbers than 9 are constructed using powers of the base: ten, a hundred, athousand, and so on. The place in which a digit is written, then, represents that number of one of these powersof ten for example, working from right to left, in the numeral 2345 the 5 represents5 ones (or units), the 4 represents 4 tens, the 3 represents 3 hundreds and the 2 represents2 thousands. thenumeral 2345 is essentially a clever piece of shorthand, condensing a complicated mathematicalexpression into four symbols, as follows:(2 × 103) + (3 × 102) + (4 × 101) + 5 = 2345. Perversely, we work from right to left in determining the place values, withincreasing powers of ten as we move in this direction. But, since we read from left to right,the numeral is read with the largest place value first the principle of exchange.This means that whenever you have accumulated ten in one place, this can be exchanged forone in the next place to the left. This principle of being able to ‘exchange one of these for tenof those’ as you move left to right along the powers of ten, or to ‘exchange ten of these for oneof those’ as you move right to left, is a very significant feature of the place-value system. This principle of exchanging is also fundamental to the ways we do calculations withnumbers. It is the principle of ‘carrying one’ in addition It also means that,when necessary, we can exchange one in any place for ten in the next place on the right, forexample when doing subtraction by decomposition. It also means that,when necessary, we can exchange one in any place for ten in the next place on the right, forexample when doing subtraction by decomposition How does the number line support understanding of place value? What is meant by saying that zero is a place holder?‘three hundred and seven’ represented in base-ten blocks. Translated into symbols,without the use of a zero, this would easily be confused with thirty-seven: 37. The zero is used therefore as a place holder; that is, to indicate the positionof the tens’ place, even though there are no tensthere: 307. It is worth noting, therefore, that when wesee a numeral such as 300, we should not think toourselves that the 00 means ‘hundred’.It is the position of the 3 that indicates that it stands for ‘three hundred’; the function of the zeros is to make thisposition clear whilst indicating that there are no tensand no ones. How is understanding of place value used in ordering numbers?Itis always the first digit in a numeral that is most significant in determining the size of the number. A statement that one number is greater than another (for example, 25 is greater than 16) orless than another (for example, 16 is less than 25) is called an inequality How are numbers rounded to the nearest 10 or the nearest 100?Rounding is an important skill in handling numbersOne skill to be learnt is to round a number or quantity to the nearest something. round a 2-digit number to the nearest ten. 67 lies between 60 and 70, but is nearer to 70","link":"/lucfe-hexo/0004%20Formal%20science/%E6%95%B0%E5%AD%A6%20Mathematics/math_primary/"},{"title":"computer science","text":"The 2012 ACM Computing Classification System on wikipediaHardwarePrinted circuit boardPeripheralIntegrated circuitVery Large Scale IntegrationSystems on Chip (SoCs)Energy consumption (Green computing)Electronic design automationHardware acceleration Computer systems organizationComputer architectureEmbedded systemReal-time computingDependability NetworksNetwork architectureNetwork protocolNetwork componentsNetwork schedulerNetwork performance evaluationNetwork service Software organizationInterpreterMiddlewareVirtual machineOperating systemSoftware quality Software notations and toolsProgramming paradigmProgramming languageCompilerDomain-specific languageModeling languageSoftware frameworkIntegrated development environmentSoftware configuration managementSoftware librarySoftware repository Software developmentControl variableSoftware development processRequirements analysisSoftware designSoftware constructionSoftware deploymentSoftware engineeringSoftware maintenanceProgramming teamOpen-source model Theory of computationModel of computationFormal languageAutomata theoryComputability theoryComputational complexity theoryLogicSemantics AlgorithmsAlgorithm designAnalysis of algorithmsAlgorithmic efficiencyRandomized algorithmComputational geometry Mathematics of computingDiscrete mathematicsProbabilityStatisticsMathematical softwareInformation theoryMathematical analysisNumerical analysisTheoretical computer science Information systemsDatabase management systemInformation storage systemsEnterprise information systemSocial information systemsGeographic information systemDecision support systemProcess control systemMultimedia information systemData miningDigital libraryComputing platformDigital marketingWorld Wide WebInformation retrieval SecurityCryptographyFormal methodsSecurity servicesIntrusion detection systemHardware securityNetwork securityInformation securityApplication security Human–computer interactionInteraction designSocial computingUbiquitous computingVisualizationAccessibility ConcurrencyConcurrent computingParallel computingDistributed computingMultithreadingMultiprocessing Artificial intelligenceNatural language processingKnowledge representation and reasoningComputer visionAutomated planning and schedulingSearch methodologyControl methodPhilosophy of artificial intelligenceDistributed artificial intelligence Machine learningSupervised learningUnsupervised learningReinforcement learningMulti-task learningCross-validation GraphicsAnimationRenderingPhotograph manipulationGraphics processing unitMixed realityVirtual realityImage compressionSolid modeling Applied computingE-commerceEnterprise softwareComputational mathematicsComputational physicsComputational chemistryComputational biologyComputational social scienceComputational engineeringComputational healthcareDigital artElectronic publishingCyberwarfareElectronic votingVideo gamesWord processingOperations researchEducational technologyDocument management","link":"/lucfe-hexo/0004%20Formal%20science/%E8%AE%A1%E7%AE%97%E6%9C%BA%E7%A7%91%E5%AD%A6%E6%8A%80%E6%9C%AF%20Computer%20science/0000%20Computer%20Science/"},{"title":"","text":"htmlA markup language is a text-encoding system consisting of a set of symbols inserted in a text document to control its structure, formatting, or the relationship between its parts.[1] Markup is often used to control the display of the document or to enrich its content to facilitate automated processing. A markup language is a set of rules governing what markup information may be included in a document and how it is combined with the content of the document in a way to facilitate use by humans and computer programs. most modern markup languages, such as XML, identify document components (for example headings, paragraphs, and tables), with the expectation that technology, such as stylesheets, will be used to apply formatting or other processing. markup meta-languages XML allow designers to specify particular schemas, which determine which elements, attributes, and other features are permitted, and where. The schemas are a set of ‘types’, each associated with a set of properties. The types are arranged in a hierarchy. What is Schema Markup?Firstly, what is Schema? In essence, this is part of adding extra information to online content to allow search engines to have a better picture of what a website is about. This extra information isn’t viewed by users on-screen but inserted as part of HTML code. It is a form of microdata, which is read by the search engine spiders when crawling your website. It helps the search engine understand what your page is actually about. This should be an addition to keywords in your content, which are chosen as means of good SEO practice. “Schema Markup” is the action of adding this data into your site’s coding based on vocabulary from the community at Schema.org. Schema is so relevant because the community is sponsored by Google, Microsoft, Yahoo and Yandex. Knowing which words to use in relation to your content are pre-determined. There is a hierarchical family tree, if you will, to follow. These are words which would benefit users if the sites had mark ups installed on them. Getting started with schema.org using Microdata Some markup languages, such as the widely used HTML, have pre-defined presentation semantics, meaning that their specifications prescribe some aspects of how to present the structured data on particular media. css js ux designFlutter is an open-source UI software development kit created by Google. It is used to develop cross platform applications from a single codebase for any web browser,[4] Fuchsia, Android, iOS, Linux, macOS, and Windows software developmentsoftware development kitA software development kit (SDK) is a collection of software development tools in one installable package. They facilitate the creation of applications by having a compiler, debugger and sometimes a software framework. software frameworkIn computer programming, a software framework is an abstraction in which software, providing generic functionality, can be selectively changed by additional user-written code, thus providing application-specific software. It provides a standard way to build and deploy applications and is a universal, reusable software environment that provides particular functionality as part of a larger software platform to facilitate the development of software applications, products and solutions. Software frameworks may include support programs, compilers, code libraries, toolsets, and application programming interfaces (APIs) that bring together all the different components to enable development of a project or system. In a framework, unlike in libraries or in standard user applications, the overall program’s flow of control is not dictated by the caller, but by the framework.[1] This is usually achieved with the Template Method Pattern. The intent of the template method is to define the overall structure of the operation, while allowing subclasses to refine, or redefine, certain steps Abstractionabstraction抽象a general idea not based on any particular real person, thing or situation; the quality of being abstract Abstraction, in general, is a fundamental concept in computer science and software development.[4] The process of abstraction can also be referred to as modeling and is closely related to the concepts of theory and design.[5] Models can also be considered types of abstractions per their generalization of aspects of reality. software platformA computing platform or digital platform[1] or software platform is an environment in which a piece of software is executed.It may be the hardware or the operating system (OS), even a web browser and associated application programming interfaces, or other underlying software, as long as the program code is executed with it.Computing platforms have different abstraction levels, including a computer architecture, an OS, or runtime libraries. application programming interface (API)An application programming interface (API) is a way for two or more computer programs to communicate with each other. It is a type of software interface, offering a service to other pieces of software.A document or standard that describes how to build or use such a connection or interface is called an API specification. A computer system that meets this standard is said to implement or expose an API. libraryIn computer science, a library is a collection of non-volatile resources used by computer programs, often for software development. These may include configuration data, documentation, help data, message templates, pre-written code and subroutines, classes, values or type specifications.or partitioned data sets. nodejsJavaScript 和 Node.js 相关的工具和包管理器： Yarn：Yarn 是 JavaScript 的包管理器，它与 npm (Node Package Manager) 类似，用于下载、安装和管理 JavaScript 包。Yarn 的主要目标是提供更快的速度和更可靠的依赖管理。 Yeoman (yo)：Yeoman 是一个用于生成项目模板和代码脚手架的工具。通过 Yeoman，你可以创建项目的基本结构，并自定义各种项目文件和配置。 npm：npm 是 Node.js 的默认包管理器，用于安装和管理 JavaScript 包。它是 Node.js 生态系统中的标准工具，允许开发人员轻松地共享和使用 JavaScript 模块。 npx：npx 是一个用于执行 Node.js 包或命令的工具。它通常用于一次性运行某个命令，而不需要全局安装相应的包。这使得你可以在不污染全局命名空间的情况下运行特定的工具或脚本。yaml inferno software QASoftware quality assurance refers to monitoring the software engineering processes and methods used to ensure quality. Code review (sometimes referred to as peer review) is a software quality assurance activity in which one or several people check a program mainly by viewing and reading parts of its source code, and they do so after implementation or as an interruption of implementation. At least one of the persons must not be the code’s author. The persons performing the checking, excluding the author, are called “reviewers” software architectsystem designSystem design is the process of defining the architecture, interfaces, and data for a system that satisfies specific requirements.

It is primarily used to generate detailed images conditioned on text descriptions, though it can also be applied to other tasks such as inpainting, outpainting, and generating image-to-image translations guided by a text prompt. Inpainting is a conservation process where damaged, deteriorated, or missing parts of an artwork are filled in to present a complete image.[1] This process is commonly used in image restoration. prompt engineeringOne of the most exciting recent advancements is in the realm of artificial intelligence (AI), where machines are trained to think, learn, and even communicate like humans.

OS-level virtualization is an operating system (OS) paradigm in which the kernel allows the existence of multiple isolated user space instances, called containers (LXC, Solaris containers, Docker, Podman), zones (Solaris containers), virtual private servers (OpenVZ), partitions, virtual environments (VEs), virtual kernels (DragonFly BSD), or jails (FreeBSD jail or chroot jail).[1] Such instances may look like real computers from the point of view of programs running in them. A computer program running on an ordinary operating system can see all resources (connected devices, files and folders, network shares, CPU power, quantifiable hardware capabilities) of that computer. However, programs running inside of a container can only see the container’s contents and devices assigned to the container. paradigm范例；样式a typical example or pattern of sth In system administration, orchestration is the automated configuring, coordinating, and managing of computer systems and software. orchestration编排，管弦乐编曲the act of arranging a piece of music for an orchestra and assigning parts to the different musical instruments orchestra管弦乐队a large group of people who play various musical instruments together, led by a conductor DOCKER 单片机 devOpsdevOpsDevOps is a methodology in the software development and IT industry.

CSS frameworkscssCSS 是层叠样式表（Cascading Style Sheets）的缩写，它是一种用于描述网页上元素外观和布局的标记语言。CSS 用于控制网页的样式，包括文字的字体、颜色、大小，以及元素的边框、间距、宽度和高度等。 CSS 的主要功能包括： 样式定义：通过 CSS，你可以为 HTML 文档中的各个元素定义样式规则。这些规则可以应用于特定的 HTML 元素，例如标题、段落、链接、表格等。 布局控制：CSS 允许你控制元素的位置和布局，包括盒子模型、浮动、定位和弹性布局等。这有助于实现网页的多列布局、居中对齐等复杂结构。 样式继承：CSS 具有层叠性，允许多个样式规则同时应用到同一元素上。这种层叠性的特性允许样式从不同来源（例如浏览器默认样式、外部样式表、内部样式表、内联样式等）中继承和叠加。 响应式设计：通过媒体查询和响应式设计技术，CSS 可以根据不同的设备尺寸和屏幕分辨率自动调整网页布局和样式，以提供更好的用户体验。 动画和过渡：CSS 也支持动画和过渡效果，使开发人员能够创建平滑的动画效果，而无需使用 JavaScript 或其他技术。 CSS 通常与 HTML 结合使用，HTML 用于创建网页的结构和内容，而 CSS 用于定义这些内容的外观和样式。这种分离的方式使得开发人员可以更容易地管理和维护网页的样式，同时也提供了更大的灵活性，允许更改样式而不必修改 HTML 结构。 css预处理器Sass、SCSS 和 Less 都是用于编写层叠样式表（CSS）的预处理器，它们增强了原始的 CSS，提供了更多的功能和便利性。这些预处理器允许你使用变量、嵌套规则、函数、混合（Mixins）等功能来更有效地编写和维护样式。 Sass（Syntactically Awesome Stylesheets）：Sass 是一种CSS预处理器，最初使用缩进的方式来定义样式规则。它引入了变量、嵌套规则和混合等功能，使得样式代码更具可维护性和可读性。Sass的文件扩展名为.sass。 SCSS（Sassy CSS）：SCSS 是 Sass 3 引入的一种新语法，它更接近原始的 CSS 语法，使用花括号和分号来定义规则。SCSS 保留了 Sass 的所有功能，但以更传统的方式书写，这使得它更容易学习和迁移现有的 CSS 代码。SCSS的文件扩展名为.scss。 Less：Less 是另一个流行的CSS预处理器，它也提供了变量、嵌套规则和混合等功能。Less的语法与原始CSS类似，但添加了扩展功能。Less的文件扩展名为.less。 这些预处理器允许你在编写样式时更加模块化、可重用和可维护。在开发大型项目或需要复杂样式的项目中，它们可以显著提高工作效率和代码质量。一旦你编写了这些预处理器的样式文件，需要将它们编译成普通的CSS文件，然后在网页中使用。通常，有许多工具和构建系统可用于自动完成这个编译过程。 StylusStylus 是另一种用于编写层叠样式表（CSS）的CSS预处理器，它提供了一种简洁的、缩进式的语法，旨在减少冗余并提高样式表的可读性。Stylus 与 Sass、SCSS 和 Less 类似，它允许你使用变量、嵌套规则、混合（Mixins）等高级功能来组织和管理样式。 与其他预处理器不同，Stylus的语法更加自由和灵活。它不需要使用大括号 {} 或分号 ;，而是依赖于缩进和换行来定义规则。 bulmahttps://bulma.io/ Bulma: the modernCSS framework thatjust works.Bulma is a free, open source framework that provides ready-to-use frontend components that you can easily combine to build responsive web interfaces. rustRust is a multi-paradigm, general-purpose programming language that emphasizes performance, type safety, and concurrency. paradigma typical example or pattern of something; a model. concurrency In computer science, concurrency is the ability of different parts or units of a program, algorithm, or problem to be executed out-of-order or in partial order, without affecting the outcome. This allows for parallel execution of the concurrent units, which can significantly improve overall speed of the execution in multi-processor and multi-core systems. concurrent(with sth) 并存的；同时发生的existing or happening at the same time Rust has been used in software spanning across different domains.

A scripting language or script language is a programming language that is used to manipulate, customize, and automate the facilities of an existing system.[1] Scripting languages are usually interpreted at runtime rather than compiled. A scripting language’s primitives are usually elementary tasks or API calls,and the scripting language allows them to be combined into more programs. Environments that can be automated through scripting include application software, text editors, web pages, operating system shells, embedded systems, and computer games. A scripting language can be viewed as a domain-specific language for a particular environment; in the case of scripting an application, it is also known as an extension language.

A healthy diet may contain fruits, vegetables, and whole grains, and may include little to no processed food or sweetened beverages. The requirements for a healthy diet can be met from a variety of plant-based and animal-based foods A whole grain is a grain of any cereal and pseudocereal that contains the endosperm, germ, and bran, in contrast to refined grains, which retain only the endosperm.全谷物是指任何含有胚乳、胚芽和麸皮的谷物和伪谷物，而精制谷物只保留胚乳。 1.1.1. The seven major classes of nutrientsEssential nutrients cannot be synthesized in the organism in sufficient quantities for survival, and therefore must be obtained through the diet. 1.1.1.1. carbohydratesCarbohydrates may be classified as monosaccharides, disaccharides or polysaccharides depending on the number of monomer (sugar) units they contain. They are a diverse group of substances, with a range of chemical, physical and physiological properties. They make up a large part of foods such as rice, noodles, bread, and other grain-based products Monosaccharides contain one sugar unit, disaccharides two, and polysaccharides three or more. 1.1.1.2. fatDifferent foods contain different amounts of fat with different proportions of saturated and unsaturated fatty acids. Some animal products, like beef and dairy products made with whole or reduced fat milk like yogurt, ice cream, cheese and butter have mostly saturated fatty acids (and some have significant contents of dietary cholesterol). Other animal products, like pork, poultry, eggs, and seafood have mostly unsaturated fats. Plants and fish oil generally contain a higher proportion of unsaturated acids, although there are exceptions such as coconut oil and palm kernel oil. Many careful studies have found that replacing saturated fats with cis unsaturated fats in the diet reduces risk of cardiovascular diseases (CVDs), diabetes, or death. These studies prompted many medical organizations and public health departments, including the World Health Organization (WHO), to officially issue that advice. 1.1.1.3. fiberDietary fiber (in Commonwealth English fibre) or roughage is the portion of plant-derived food that cannot be completely broken down by human digestive enzymes. Dietary fiber is a carbohydrate, specifically a polysaccharide, which is incompletely absorbed in humans and in some animals. Like all carbohydrates, when it is metabolized, it can produce four Calories (kilocalories) of energy per gram, but in most circumstances, it accounts for less than that because of its limited absorption and digestibility. 1.1.1.4. mineralsDietary minerals are inorganic chemical elements required by living organisms, other than the four elements carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, and oxygen that are present in nearly all organic molecules. Macrominerals Elements with recommended dietary allowance (RDA) greater than 150 mg/day are Trace minerals Many elements are required in smaller amounts (microgram quantities), usually because they play a catalytic role in enzymes. Some trace mineral elements (RDA &lt; 200 mg/day) are Ultratrace minerals Ultratrace minerals are an as yet unproven aspect of human nutrition, and may be required at amounts measured in very low ranges of μg/day. 1.1.1.5. proteinsProteins are essential nutrients for the human body. They are one of the building blocks of body tissue and can also serve as a fuel source. The most important aspect and defining characteristic of protein from a nutritional standpoint is its amino acid(氨基酸) composition. During human digestion, proteins are broken down in the stomach to smaller polypeptide chains via hydrochloric acid and protease actions. This is crucial for the absorption of the essential amino acids that cannot be biosynthesized by the body. There are nine essential amino acids which humans must obtain from their diet in order to prevent protein-energy malnutrition and resulting death. They are phenylalanine, valine, threonine, tryptophan, methionine, leucine, isoleucine, lysine, and histidine. 1.1.1.6. vitaminsVitamins are organic molecules (or a set of closely related molecules called vitamers) that are essential to an organism in small quantities for proper metabolic(代谢 the chemical processes in living things that change food, etc. into energy and materials for growth) function. Except for vitamin D, vitamins are essential nutrients, necessary in the diet for good health. Vitamin D can be synthesized in the skin in the presence of UVB radiation. 1.1.1.7. waterWater is excreted from the body in multiple forms; including urine and feces, sweating, and by water vapour in the exhaled breath. Therefore, it is necessary to adequately rehydrate to replace lost fluids. 1.1.2. World Health Organization RecommendationsThe World Health Organization (WHO) makes the following five recommendations with respect to both populations and individuals: Maintain a healthy weight by eating roughly the same number of calories that your body is using. Limit intake of fats to no more than 30% of total caloric intake, preferring unsaturated fats to saturated(饱和) fats. Avoid trans(反式) fats. Eat at least 400 grams of fruits and vegetables per day (not counting potatoes, sweet potatoes(红薯), cassava(木薯), and other starchy roots(淀粉根)). A healthy diet also contains legumes (e.g. lentils(扁豆), beans), whole grains, and nuts. Limit the intake of simple sugars to less than 10% of caloric intake (below 5% of calories or 25 grams may be even better). Limit salt/sodium(钠) from all sources and ensure that salt is iodized(加碘). Less than 5 grams of salt per day can reduce the risk of cardiovascular(心血管) disease. The WHO has stated that insufficient vegetables and fruit is the cause of 2.8% of deaths worldwide. Other WHO recommendations include: ensuring that the foods chosen have sufficient vitamins and certain minerals; avoiding directly poisonous (e.g. heavy metals) and carcinogenic(致癌) (e.g. benzene 苯) substances; avoiding foods contaminated by human pathogens (e.g. E. coli 大肠杆菌, tapeworm eggs 绦虫卵); and replacing saturated fats with polyunsaturated fats in the diet, which can reduce the risk of coronary artery(Coronary means belonging or relating to the heart.冠状动脉) disease and diabetes(糖尿病). 1.1.3. 中国居民膳食指南膳食指南 是以食物为基础、以营养科学为依据的一组原则性建议和群众宣传教育手段。它的目的在于指导大众合理用餐以改善营养，预防与膳食有关的疾病，增进人群的健康。膳食指南是在长期社会实践的过程中发展起来的。 膳食指南的内容 食物多样、谷物为主。各种食物所含营养成分不同，没有一种食物能供给人体所需的全部营养素，所以每日膳食必须由多种多样的食物适当搭配，以满足人体对多种经营素的需要。 多吃蔬菜、水果和薯类。蔬菜水果和薯类都含有较丰富的维生素、矿物质及膳食纤维等营养素，对保护心血管健康，增强抗病力和预防某些癌症有重要作用。 常吃奶类、豆类或其制品。经常吃奶类可以提高儿童、青少年的骨密度，减缓老年人骨质疏松症。豆类营养丰富，含优质蛋白、不饱和脂肪酸、钙及 B 族维生素等多种营养物质，既可改善膳食营养素供给，又可避免吃肉类过多的不利影响。 经常吃适量鱼、禽、蛋、瘦肉，少吃肥肉和荤油。鱼、禽、蛋及瘦肉是优质蛋白、脂溶性维生素和某些矿物质的重要来源。 食量与体力活动要平衡，保持适当的体重。 吃清淡少盐的膳食。食品不应太油腻、太咸，少吃油炸、烟熏食物。每人每日食盐用量以不超过 6 克为宜；少吃咸菜、味精等含钠的食物；吃盐多会增加高血压的危险。 饮酒应限量。白酒除具有能量外，不含有其他的营养素。 吃清洁、卫生、不变质的食物。 平衡膳食宝塔 中国居民平衡膳食宝塔是根据中国居民膳食指南，结合中国居民的膳食，把平衡膳食的原则转化成各类食物的重量，便于大家在日常生活中实行。 平衡膳食宝塔共分五层，包含我们每天应吃的主要食物种类。宝塔各层位置和面积不同，这在一定程度上反映出各类食物在膳食中的地位和应占的比重。谷类食物位居底层，每人每天应该吃 300-500 克；蔬菜和水果占据第二层，每天应吃 400-500 克和 100-200 克；鱼、禽、肉、蛋等动物性食物位于第三层，每天应该吃 125-200 克（鱼虾类 50 克，畜、禽肉 50-100 克，蛋类 25-50 克）；奶类和豆类食物合占第四层，每天应该吃奶类及奶制品 100 克和豆类及豆制品 50 克。第五层塔尖是油脂类，每天不超过 25 克。 宝塔没有建议食糖的摄入量。因为我国居民现在平均吃食糖的量还不多，少吃些或适当多吃些可能对健康的影响不大。但多吃糖有增加龋齿的危险，尤其是儿童、青少年不应吃太多的糖和含糖食品。 宝塔建议的各类食物的摄入量一般是指食物的生重。各类食物的组成是根据全国营养调查中居民膳食的实际情况计算的，所以每一类食物中毒的重量不是指某一种具体食物的重量。 谷类：是指面粉、大米、玉米粉、小麦、高粱等的总和。它们是膳食中能量的主要来源。 蔬菜和水果：蔬菜和水果经常放在一起，因为它们有许多共性。但蔬菜和水果终究是两类食物，各有优势，不能完全彼此替代。 鱼肉蛋：鱼、肉、蛋归为一类，主要提供动物性蛋白质和一些重要的无机盐和维生素。但它们彼此间也有明显区别。 奶类和豆类食物：宝塔建议的 100 克是按蛋白质和钙的含量来折算的，约相当于鲜奶 200 克或奶粉 28 克。中国居民膳食中普遍缺钙，奶类应是首选补钙食物，很难用其他类食物代替。 1.2. exerciseExercise is a body activity that enhances or maintains physical fitness and overall health and wellness Aerobic exercise is any physical activity that uses large muscle groups and causes the body to use more oxygen than it would while resting. The goal of aerobic exercise is to increase cardiovascular(心血管的 connected with the heart and the blood vessels) endurance. Examples of aerobic exercise include running, cycling, swimming, brisk walking, skipping rope, rowing, hiking, dancing, playing tennis, continuous training, and long distance running. Anaerobic exercise is a type of exercise that breaks down glucose in the body without using oxygen; anaerobic means “without oxygen”.Anaerobic exercise, which includes strength and resistance training, can firm, strengthen, and increase muscle mass, as well as improve bone density, balance, and coordination. Flexibility exercises stretch and lengthen muscles. 1.3. sleepAdults (18–64 years) 7 to 9 hours 1.4. self careSelf-care has been defined as the process of establishing behaviors to ensure holistic well-being of oneself, to promote health, and actively manage illness when it occurs. Individuals engage in some form of self-care daily with food choices, exercise, sleep, reading and dental care.","link":"/lucfe-hexo/0005%20Applied%20science/%E5%8C%BB%E5%AD%A6%20Medicine%20and%20health/health/"},{"title":"","text":"ebookamazon bookset browser vpn -&gt; usathe book product category can show up","link":"/lucfe-hexo/0005%20Applied%20science/%E5%9B%BE%E4%B9%A6%E9%A6%86%20%E6%83%85%E6%8A%A5%E4%B8%8E%E6%96%87%E7%8C%AE%E5%AD%A6%20Library%20and%20museum%20studies/amazon%20ebook/"},{"title":"","text":"农业植物生产类 090101 农学 农学农业工程类 082301 农业工程 工学 《农业气象学》、 《植物生理与生物化学》、 《农业微生物学》、《植物生物技术导论》、《农业生态学》、 《遗传学》、《育种学》、 《植物生理学实验》、 《作物栽培与耕作学》、 《农业经济管理》 谷物为主谷类作物亦称“禾谷类作物”。属于禾本科,只有蓼科植物的荞麦例外。粮食作物主要包括稻子、小麦、大麦、黑麦、燕麦、玉米、高粱、粟、黍、稷等。 小麦和水稻是世界各国最主要的粮食作物，也是人类主要的两大食用作物。 其中的子粒称“谷物”，为食用对象；带壳或稃的称“谷”，去壳的叫“米”，是人们的主食之一。子粒中含有大量的淀粉和一定比例的蛋白质和脂肪等。 单子叶植物（英文名：Monocotyledons，简称monocots），旧名单子叶植物纲（Monocotyledoneae）或百合纲（Liliopsida）单子叶植物种子的胚具1片子叶，植物多为草本单子叶植物实际是由古代的双子叶植物演化而来，是双子叶植物的其中一个特化分支。在传统的克朗奎斯特分类法中，单子叶植物被称做“百合纲”，和双子叶植物的木兰纲并立禾本目（Poales）禾本目是单子叶植物的一个目。 面粉、大米、玉米粉、小麦、高粱 小麦面粉 面粉或小麦粉（英语：wheat flour）是一种由小麦或者其它谷物研磨而成的粉末，是世界上最常见的食品原料之一，经常需要加水变为面团，再蒸烤食用。面粉承担了人类食物中的“主食”和“甜点”的大部分，例如各种面包、馒头、蛋糕、面条、饼、饼干等均由面粉制作。 面筋，是指使生面团具有筋力的物质（麸质或麦麸）。实际上筋力高低主要取决于面粉中的蛋白质含量的高低。越“高筋”所产生的弹力和粘性则越高，反之则越低。 面粉可以分为特高筋面粉、高筋面粉、中筋面粉、低筋面粉及无筋面粉。五种面粉的分别在于其黏度的不同。 高筋面粉蛋白质含量约12.5 ~ 13.5%，蛋白质含量高，因此筋度强，适合各种西式面包因为其韧性较高，经烘焙后蓬松厚实、有小孔、仍得保持形状，极度适合添加巧克力、奶油、肉桂粉、奶酪、果酱等其它食物。 中筋面粉蛋白质含量为9.5 ~ 12.0%，适合绝大部分咸味的中式面食和小部分中式甜点，包括包子、馒头、中式面条、饺子和小笼包等，属于最万用的。 低筋面粉蛋白质含量在8.5%以下，因此筋性亦弱，质地更加柔嫩顺滑，多用来做蛋糕 高粱高粱（Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench），禾本科高粱属一年生高大草本植物。选地：高粱根系发达吸水吸肥力强，宜选择平坦疏松较肥沃的地块种植。因高粱有抗旱耐涝耐盐碱耐瘠薄的特性，所以低洼易涝地块或是瘠薄干旱的盐碱地块也可种植。因高粱对农药敏感，所以忌选前茬施用长残效类农药的地块。 轮作倒茬高粱忌连作，合理的轮作方式是高粱增产的关键。高粱的理想前茬是大豆茬，其次是玉米茬、马铃薯茬等。适宜的后茬最好是大豆茬、或与玉米、谷子轮作。 收获面积和总产量仅次于小麦、水稻、玉米，是世界四大谷类作物之一。高粱为粗粮，口感不好。其中含有单宁，便秘者少食或不食。高粱淀粉含量高，酿酒没有其他干扰味道，适合酿造中国白酒，是中国白酒中的主要酿造原料。高粱也是传统扫帚的材料 荞麦 荞麦（Fagopyrum esculentum Moench），别名：净肠草、乌麦、三角麦，是蓼科（Polygonaceae） 荞麦适应性较强，对土壤的要求不高，很多土壤条件都能适应，不过最好的还是较疏松的沙壤土。虽然荞麦具有很强的适应能力 荞麦的谷蛋白含量很低，主要的蛋白质是球蛋白。荞麦所含的必需氨基酸中的赖氨酸含量高而蛋氨酸的含量低，氨基酸模式可以与主要的谷物（如小麦、玉米、大米的赖氨酸含量较低）互补。 荞麦的碳水化合物主要是淀粉。因为颗粒较细小，所以和其他谷类相比，具有容易煮熟、容易消化、容易加工的特点。 荞麦含有丰富的膳食纤维，其含量是一般精制大米的10倍；荞麦含有丰富的膳食纤维，膳食纤维被称为人类的第七类营养素，可以促进胃肠蠕动，通便，对于预防便秘有很好的作用，还可以降低血糖血脂，对人类的健康意义重大。 粟sù，是禾本科狗尾草属草本植物。直到宋末，稻、小麦逐渐发展，粟才退居二线。粟一般是指现代的小米,谷粒去皮后称为“小米”，煮粥、煮饭都可以,外壳是黄色 《本草纲目》称粘者为黍，不粘者为稷jì 黍 黍一般是指现代的黄米。黍去皮后叫黄米,粟一般是指现代的小米，外壳的颜色是红色。颗粒比小米要大一些 黍shǔ，属单子叶禾本科黍属一年生草本植物。黍为人类最早的栽培谷物之一，谷粒富含淀粉，供食用或酿酒，它还富含维生素等对儿童生长发育有重要作用的营养物质 有红、白黄、黑几个品种。白黍米粘性次于糯米，红黍米粘性最强，可以煮粥。可以包粽子吃。 蔬菜、水果和薯类十字花科白菜萝卜油菜荠菜卷心菜 葫芦科黄瓜南瓜丝瓜西瓜冬瓜葫芦 茄科马铃薯茄子番茄辣椒烟草枸杞 薯类薯类作物又称根茎类作物，主要包括甘薯、马铃薯、山药、芋类等。这类作物的产品器官是块根和块茎，生长在土壤中，具有生长前期和块根(茎)膨大期两个生理分期。 甘薯甘薯又称番薯、山芋、红薯、地瓜等 马铃薯马铃薯又称土豆、洋芋、山药蛋等 豆类豆类泛指所有能产生豆荚的豆科植物 豆类作物不耐连作，连作时由于噬菌体的繁衍抑制了根瘤菌的发育而影响生长，同时病虫害加重，产量品质降低。所以豆类作物要实行轮作才能获得高产。豆类作物适宜的前茬为禾谷类作物、薯类作物和棉花 豆类作物主要是大豆、蚕豆、红豆、绿豆、黑豆、豇豆、豌豆、刀豆、扁豆、芸豆、鹰嘴豆、木豆等。 黄豆（又称大豆）大豆的营养成分非常丰富，其蛋白质含量高于谷类和薯类食物２.５～８倍，除糖类较低外，其他营养成分，如脂肪、钙、磷、铁和维生素Ｂ１、维生素Ｂ２等人体必需的营养物质，都高于谷类和薯类食物，它是一种理想的优质植物蛋白食物。 大豆可以加工豆腐、豆浆、腐竹等豆制品 发酵豆制品包括腐乳、臭豆腐、豆瓣酱、酱油、豆豉、纳豆等。而非发酵豆制品包括水豆腐、干豆腐（百页）、豆芽 毛豆是尚未成熟的食用大豆，约在荚果种子生长至八分熟时采收。毛豆一词，可指此鲜豆荚或鲜豆荚内的八分熟种子。因为此时期的豆荚外皮尚有很多细毛，所以得名； 黑豆 绿豆 蚕豆 豌豆 豇jiāng豆 豇豆（Vigna unguiculata (L.) Walp.），豆科豇豆属一年生缠绕、草质藤本或近直立草本植物豇豆的嫩豆荚和豆粒味道鲜美，食用方法多种多样，可炒、煮、炖、拌、做馅等。嫩豆荚可炒食，也可凉拌，另外还可用于加工腌泡、速冻、干制、保鲜菜,加工成罐头等。干种子还可以煮粥、煮饭、制酱、制粉。 豇豆耐高温，不耐低温，属于短日性作物，喜强光，光照弱时易落花落荚，耐旱力较强，但不耐涝，选择土壤肥沃、疏松的地区种植。 奶类中国居民膳食中普遍缺钙，奶类应是首选补钙食物，很难用其他类食物代替。 禽、蛋、鱼、瘦肉湖北省黄梅县的蔬菜种植湖北省黄梅县的蔬菜种植季节和可种植的蔬菜种类会受到当地气候、土壤和季节变化的影响。以下是一些通常在黄梅县每个季节可以栽种的蔬菜和一般的栽种日期： 春季蔬菜（一般从3月到5月）： 菠菜：3月至4月 生菜：3月至4月 芥菜：3月至4月 大葱：3月至4月 青椒：3月至4月 茄子：3月至4月

玉米（Corn）：玉米通常在春季进行播种，时间在4月至5月之间。收获时间则在8月至10月之间，取决于品种和气候。 大豆（Soybeans）：大豆的种植季节也是春季，通常在4月至5月之间进行播种，而收获时间在8月至10月之间。 红薯（Sweet Potatoes）：红薯是湖北东部的重要作物之一，通常在春季进行种植，时间在4月至5月之间。收获时间通常在9月至11月之间，具体时间取决于品种和生长条件。 需要注意的是，播种和收获日期可能会因气候、土壤条件和具体的农作物品种而有所不同。种植者通常会根据当地的气象和土壤情况来确定最佳的时间。此外，现代农业技术也可以影响作物的种植和收获时间。因此，最好的做法是咨询当地的农业专家或农民，以获取最准确的信息。 种植土豆在湖北东部地区种植土豆需要考虑当地的气候、土壤和品种选择。以下是一个基本的土豆种植方案，但请注意，具体的步骤和时间表可能会因当地条件而异。在种植前，建议咨询当地的农业专家或农民，以获取更详细的指导。 土壤准备： 首先，进行土壤测试以了解土壤的营养状况和pH值。土壤的pH应在5.0至6.0之间，这对于土豆的生长较为理想。 清理田地，去除杂草和石头。 品种选择： 选择适合当地气候和土壤条件的土豆品种。湖北东部的气候可能会在不同季节有所不同，因此要选择适应这种气候的品种。 播种： 春季是土豆的主要播种季节。在湖北东部，播种通常在4月至5月之间进行。 在准备好的土壤中，根据品种和行距的要求挖槽或开沟。行距通常在30至45厘米之间，而槽深度约为10至15厘米。 将土豆种子切成块，每个块应包含至少一个眼（芽）。种子块应在槽中均匀分布，通常每隔30至45厘米放一个块。 覆盖土豆种子块，确保它们与土壤接触紧密。 生长和护理： 保持土壤湿润，但不要过于浸泡。土豆需要充足的水分，特别是在开花和结薯期间。 定期除草，以确保杂草不会竞争土壤中的养分和水分。 鉴于土壤测试的结果，可能需要施加适当的肥料，以满足土豆的养分需求。 收获： 土豆的收获通常在生长季节后的90至120天进行，具体时间取决于品种和生长条件。 使用铁锹或铲子轻轻挖出土豆块，小心不要损伤它们。将土豆清洗干净，晾干，然后储存在凉爽、干燥、通风良好的地方。 以上是一个一般的土豆种植方案的概述，但请注意，成功种植土豆还需要密切关注气象条件和土壤状况，以及在不同生长阶段采取适当的护理措施。在整个种植季节中，定期监测和管理病虫害也非常重要。最好的做法是与当地的农业专家或农民合作，以获取实际的建议和指导。 红薯种植在湖北东部，红薯通常是通过插蔓条的方式进行种植。以下是一个详细的种植方案，包括母株的播种时间和后续步骤： 播种母株薯块： 选择健康的母株：在春季，通常在3月至4月之间，选择健康的红薯母株薯块。这些薯块应该没有明显的病害或损伤，并且具有良好的生长特征。 储存和发芽：将选好的母株薯块储存在温暖、湿润的环境中，让它们发芽。通常需要2至4周的时间，直到薯块上出现足够多的蔓条。 插蔓条：3. 蔓条的准备：等到蔓条足够长（大约15-20厘米）后，小心地将蔓条剪下，确保每个蔓条上有几个叶片。 插蔓条：在4月至6月之间，选择适当的时间，将蔓条插入土壤中。通常，蔓条之间的距离应保持在30-40厘米，而蔓条在行内的距离可以略宽，以便红薯的生长和扩展。 土壤和管理：5. 土壤准备：在插蔓条之前，确保土壤富含有机物质，排水良好，并且PH值适宜。红薯在富含有机质和排水良好的土壤中生长最佳。 管理和施肥：定期除草，确保红薯获得足够的养分。可以在播种时添加适当的肥料，然后根据土壤测试的结果进行追加施肥。 灌溉：保持土壤湿润，但不要过度浸水。红薯需要足够的水分来生长，特别是在干旱的季节。 病虫害管理：密切监测植株，防止病虫害的发生，并采取必要的措施来控制它们，以确保作物的健康生长。 收获：9. 收获时间：红薯的收获时间通常在9月至11月之间，具体时间取决于品种和生长条件。当蔓叶开始枯萎，并且地下块茎已经成熟时，可以开始收获。 谨慎收获：小心地挖起地下块茎，避免损伤它们。将红薯清洗干净，然后储存在阴凉、通风良好的地方。

result, but the steps necessary to achieve that result. time management Planning is the process of thinking regarding the activities required to achieve a desired goal. It involves of various demands upon a person relating to work, social life, family, hobbies, personal interests, and commitments with the finite nature of time. Using time effectively gives the person “choice” on spending or managing activities at their own time and expediency. expediency不得已而做的事Expediency means doing what is convenient rather than what is morally right. Setting priorities and goals ABCD analysisA technique that has been used in business management for a long time is the categorization of large data into groups. These groups are often marked A, B, C and D—hence the name. Activities are ranked by these general criteria: A – Tasks that are perceived as being urgent and important,B – Tasks that are important but not urgent,C – Tasks that are unimportant but urgent,D – Tasks that are unimportant and not urgent.Each group is then rank-ordered by priority - to further refine the prioritization, some individuals choose to then force-rank all “B” items as either “A” or “C”. The Eisenhower Method Using the Eisenhower Decision Principle, tasks are evaluated using the criteria important/unimportant and urgent/not urgent, and then placed in according quadrants in an Eisenhower Matrix (also known as an “Eisenhower Box” or “Eisenhower Decision Matrix”). Tasks in the quadrants are then handled as follows. Important/Urgent quadrant tasks are done immediately and personally, e.g. crises, deadlines, problems.Important/Not Urgent quadrant tasks get an end date and are done personally, e.g. relationships, planning, recreation.Unimportant/Urgent quadrant tasks are delegated, e.g. interruptions, meetings, activities.Unimportant/Not Urgent quadrant tasks are dropped, e.g. time wasters, pleasant activities, trivia. delegate授(权);If you delegate duties, responsibilities, or power to someone, you give them those duties, those responsibilities, or that power so that they can act on your behalf. A basic “Eisenhower box” to help evaluate urgency and importance. Items may be placed at more precise points within each quadrant. POSEC method POSEC is an acronym for “Prioritize by Organizing, Streamlining, Economizing and Contributing”. The method dictates a template which emphasizes an average individual’s immediate sense of emotional and monetary security. It suggests that by attending to one’s personal responsibilities first, an individual is better positioned to shoulder collective responsibilities. Inherent in the acronym is a hierarchy of self-realization, which mirrors Abraham Maslow’s hierarchy of needs. Prioritize your time and define your life by goals. Organize things you have to accomplish regularly to be successful (family and finances). Streamline things you may not like to do, but must do (work and chores). Economize things you should do or may even like to do, but they’re not pressingly urgent (pastimes and socializing). Contribute by paying attention to the few remaining things that make a difference (social obligations). chres琐事Chores are tasks such as cleaning, washing, and ironing that have to be done regularly at home. obligation义务;责任If you have an obligation to do something, it is your duty to do that thing. Implementation of goalsA task list (also called a to-do list or “things-to-do”) is a list of tasks to be completed, such as chores or steps toward completing a project. It is an inventory tool which serves as an alternative or supplement to memory. Writer Julie Morgenstern suggests “do’s and don’ts” of time management that include: Map out everything that is important, by making a task list.Create “an oasis of time” for one to manage.Say “No”.Set priorities.Don’t drop everything. GTD (Getting Things Done) Getting Things Done was created by David Allen. The basic idea behind this method is to finish all the small tasks immediately and a big task is to be divided into smaller tasks to start completing now. The reasoning behind this is to avoid the information overload or “brain freeze” which is likely to occur when there are hundreds of tasks. The thrust of GTD is to encourage the user to get their tasks and ideas out and on paper and organized as quickly as possible so they’re easy to manage and see. 制定计划制定计划是一种组织和管理时间、资源和目标的有效方式。以下是一些步骤，可帮助你制定和实施计划： 明确你的目标： 定义你要实现的具体目标。确保目标具体、可测量、可实现、与你的价值观和长期目标一致。 将大目标分解为更小的、可管理的子目标或任务。 制定时间表： 为每个子目标或任务分配截止日期，以确保它们按计划完成。 创建一个时间表或日程表，将任务和活动安排在适当的时间段内。 列出任务： 将需要完成的任务和活动列成清单。这可以包括工作任务、个人事务、学习计划、锻炼等。 设置优先级： 根据任务的重要性和紧急性，确定任务的优先级顺序。使用工具如任务列表或任务管理应用来帮助管理和优先安排任务。 分配资源： 确定完成任务所需的资源，包括时间、人力、资金、工具等。确保这些资源可用并合理分配。 制定行动计划： 为每个任务制定具体的行动计划，包括步骤和所需的资源。这有助于明确如何执行任务。 跟踪和评估进展： 定期监视和评估你的进展，确保你按照计划前进。如果需要，进行调整以应对变化和挑战。 保持灵活性： 计划可能会面临变化和意外情况，所以要保持灵活性，准备应对这些变化。 奖励自己： 设定一些奖励机制，以激励自己完成任务和达到目标。奖励可以是小的自我鼓励，也可以是一些特殊的待遇或庆祝活动。 寻求支持： 如果需要，与朋友、家人或同事分享你的计划，寻求他们的支持和鼓励。有时，与他人分享目标可以帮助你更好地坚持计划。 学会管理时间： 学习时间管理技巧，例如设置时间块、减少分心、避免拖延等，以提高效率。 反思和学习： 定期回顾你的计划，了解你的成功和挑战，以及如何改进未来的计划。 最重要的是，制定计划是为了更好地组织和实现目标，但也要保持灵活性，因为生活中总会出现变化。根据需要进行调整，并继续朝着你的目标前进。","link":"/lucfe-hexo/0001%20Humanities/%E5%93%B2%E5%AD%A6%20Philosophy/self%20help/time%20management/"},{"title":"","text":"chrome keyboard shortcutMouse shortcutsOpen a link in a current tab (mouse only) Drag a link to a tabOpen a link in new background tab Ctrl + Click a linkOpen a link, and jump to it Ctrl + Shift + Click a linkOpen a link, and jump to it (mouse only) Drag a link to a blank area of the tab stripScroll horizontally on the page Shift + Scroll your mousewheelDisplay your browsing historyRight-click Back Back or click &amp; hold Back BackRight-click Next Next or click &amp; hold Next NextSave the current webpage as a bookmark Drag the web address to the Bookmarks BarSwitch between maximized and windowed modes Double-click a blank area of the tab strip Address bar shortcutsJump to the address bar Ctrl + l or Alt + d or F6Search using a different search engine Type a search engine name and press TabSearch with your default search engine Type a search term + EnterOpen a new tab and perform a Google search Type a search term + Alt + EnterAdd www. and .com to a site name, and open it in the current tab Type a site name + Ctrl + EnterSearch from anywhere on the page Ctrl + k or Ctrl + e Google Chrome feature shortcutsOpen the Chrome Task Manager Shift + EscOpen the Find Bar to search the current page Ctrl + f or F3Jump to the next match to your Find Bar search Ctrl + gJump to the previous match to your Find Bar search Ctrl + Shift + g Tab and window shortcutsOpen a new tab, and jump to it Ctrl + tOpen your home page in the current tab Alt + HomeJump to the next open tab Ctrl + Tab or Ctrl + PgDnJump to the previous open tab Ctrl + Shift + Tab or Ctrl + PgUpJump to a specific tab Ctrl + 1 through Ctrl + 8Jump to the rightmost tab Ctrl + 9Open the previous page from your browsing history in the current tab Alt + Left arrowOpen the next page from your browsing history in the current tab Alt + Right arrowClose the current tab Ctrl + w or Ctrl + F4 Webpage shortcutsReload the current page F5 or Ctrl + rReload the current page, ignoring cached content Shift + F5 or Ctrl + Shift + rStop the page loading EscTurn full-screen mode on or off F11Scroll down a webpage, a screen at a time Space or PgDnScroll up a webpage, a screen at a time Shift + Space or PgUpGo to the top of the page HomeGo to the bottom of the page End Open the Home page in the current tab Alt + Home","link":"/lucfe-hexo/0004%20Formal%20science/%E8%AE%A1%E7%AE%97%E6%9C%BA%E7%A7%91%E5%AD%A6%E6%8A%80%E6%9C%AF%20Computer%20science/Applied%20computing/chrome_keyboard_shortcut/"},{"title":"","text":"live streaming settingslive streaming video settingTelevisions are of the following resolutions Standard-definition television (SDTV): 480i (NTSC-compatible digital standard employing two interlaced fields of 243 lines each) 576i (PAL-compatible digital standard employing two interlaced fields of 288 lines each) Enhanced-definition television (EDTV): 480p (720 × 480 progressive scan) 576p (720 × 576 progressive scan) High-definition television (HDTV): 720p (1280 × 720 progressive scan) 1080i (1920 × 1080 split into two interlaced fields of 540 lines) 1080p (1920 × 1080 progressive scan) Ultra-high-definition television (UHDTV): 4K UHD (3840 × 2160 progressive scan) 8K UHD (7680 × 4320 progressive scan) interlaced and progressivethe “i” in this example indicates an “interlaced” image scan. Besides interlaced there is also another method, known as “progressive” scan. Interlaced: In the first frame, only the odd numbers of vertical lines are displayed, the even lines stay blank. In the following frame, the even numbers of vertical lines will be displayed, while the odd lines stay blank. This method effectively halves the required bandwidth and reduces flicker. Also it allows for better adaption of different frame rates, as overlapping frames can be merged into each other.Progressive: Each frame carries the full amount of vertical lines and the full image information is displayed on every single frame. Whilst requiring more video bandwidth, it will allow for better image quality compared to the interlaced method. Luminance/chrominance systems in generalThe primary advantage of luma/chroma systems such as Y′UV, and its relatives Y′IQ and YDbDr, is that they remain compatible with black and white analog television (largely due to the work of Georges Valensi). The Y′ channel saves all the data recorded by black and white cameras, so it produces a signal suitable for reception on old monochrome displays. In this case, the U and V are simply discarded. If displaying color, all three channels are used, and the original RGB information can be decoded. Another advantage of Y′UV is that some of the information can be discarded in order to reduce bandwidth. The human eye has fairly little spatial sensitivity to color: the accuracy of the brightness information of the luminance channel has far more impact on the image detail discerned than that of the other two. Understanding this human shortcoming, standards such as NTSC and PAL reduce the bandwidth of the chrominance channels considerably. (Bandwidth is in the temporal domain, but this translates into the spatial domain as the image is scanned out.) Y’CbCr Color ModelIn the Y’CbCr color model, the three colors Red, Green, and Blue are not expressed as an individual value like it is done in RGB. Instead, the information will be encoded into a luminance value (Y) and two chrominance components (Cb, Cr) chromaChrominance (chroma or C for short) is the signal used in video systems to convey the color information of the picture (see YUV color model), separately from the accompanying luma signal (or Y’ for short). Chrominance is usually represented as two color-difference components: U = B′ − Y′ (blue − luma) and V = R′ − Y′ (red − luma). Chroma SubsamplingChroma Subsampling is a method to reduce the amount of data information of a Y’CrCb video signal. The perception of the human visual system (HVS) is less sensitive to color information than it is to changes in luminance, or brightness. So even if the human vision is capable of resolving differences in luminance in fine detail, it may not recognize if chroma information is greatly reduced in the resulting picture. Basically, a video signal that takes advantage of Chroma Subsampling will use less bandwidth because the color information in the signal has a lower resolution than the brightness information. Frame RateThe frame rate of a video signal defines how many consecutive images will be displayed in a finite amount of time, to result in a motion picture perception at the viewer. Usually the frame rate is expressed in frames per second (FPS). Good examples are the two major television standards NTSC and PAL, which are referring to a frame rate of 30 FPS (NTSC) and 25 FPS (PAL). Those frame rates originated from the frequency of the mains power supply in the counties in which each standard has been established. Modern theatrical film runs at 24 FPS. This is the case for both physical film and digital cinema systems. Video over EthernetIn a single digital video signal, there are 5 relevant factors to determine how much data is required: Video Resolution - Which is the size of the digital video image - (examples: 4k, 1080p, 720p, etc… ) Frame Rate - The speed at which the digital image is refreshed - (examples: 60hz, 30hz, etc… ) Color space - The gamut of possible colors that can be represented by the color encoding of a signal. (examples: RGB, YUV, Y’CrCb) Chroma Sub-sampling - The reduction of color information by using fewer bits per pixel at a cost of color space. (examples: 4:4:4, 4:2:2, 4:2:0) Color bit-depth - This is the binary number which represents the total number of possible values for each color component. In much like digital audio, the more bits we have the greater depth possible for the signal. (examples: 10-bit, 12-bit). exampleLet’s take one example of an uncompressed video signal that is a common signal format: 1080p, 60 Hz, YUV 4:2:2, 10-bit = 2.49 Gbps We can read this line as a combination of all of the parameters we have shown above. If we were to break this statement out into a series of sentences, we read this as a digital video signal that has a resolution of 1080p with a frame rate of 60Hz. It utilizes the YUV color space and 4:2:2 chroma sub-sampling for each YUV component. There are 10-bits used for each of the three color components listed. To calculate the bandwidth we start with the resolution of the image: 1920 * 1080 (for 1080p) = 2,073,600 pixels in an image of this size. Then multiply by the refresh rate: 2,073,600 * 60Hz = 124,416,000 total pixels (per second) You can think of this number 124,416,000 as the number of pixels a display will have shown in one second of video. Now we need to remember that each pixel is made up of three components, each of them are of a certain bit depth. Furthermore we might be “sub sampling” a set of pixels to help reduce the data footprint with a small trade off in image detail. We start with the Chroma subsampling ratio of 4:2:2. This ratio is applied over a 2 x 4 block of pixels or a total of 8 pixels as we previously learned. Thus we first need to take our total number of pixels and divide them by 8: 124,416,000 pixels / 8 pixels in our 2x4 row = 15,552,000 blocks of 8 pixels. Now we calculate what we know regarding our Chroma subsampling ratio and apply that to the number of blocks making sure to include our 10-bit color bit-depth per component: Y’ = 8 pixels * 10-bits = 80 total bits for Y’ for each 8 pixel block U = 4 pixels * 10-bits = 40 total bits for U for each 8 pixel block V = 4 pixels * 10-bits = 40 total bits for V for each 8 pixel block Now we add those all together and multiply that against the number of blocks to finally arrive at the total amount of data required for this video signal: 160 bits for each 8 pixel block * 15,552,000 blocks = 2,488,320,000 total bits required for one second of video. Or more nicely expressed: 2.49 Gbps Compression — Intra-Frame: M-JPEG, JPEG 2000 Interframe: MPEG-4 part 10 / H.264 (AVC), H.265 (HVEC) Latency As low as 33 msec 200 msec or higher Bandwidth High Low Compression &lt; 25:1 &gt; 25:1 Processing Symmetric Asymmetric Error Tolerance High Low (Reference Frames) broadband speedA broadband speed of 2 Mbit/s or more is recommended for streaming standard-definition video, for example to a Roku, Apple TV, Google TV or a Sony TV Blu-ray Disc Player. 5 Mbit/s is recommended for high-definition content and 9 Mbit/s for ultra-high-definition content. Streaming media storage size is calculated from the streaming bandwidth and length of the media using the following formula (for a single user and file):storage size in megabytes is equal to length (in seconds) × bit rate (in bit/s) / (8 × 1024 × 1024). For example, one hour of digital video encoded at 300 kbit/s (this was a typical broadband video in 2005 and it was usually encoded in 320 × 240 resolution) will be: (3,600 s × 300,000 bit/s) / (8 × 1024 × 1024) requires around 128 MB of storage. Using a multicast protocol the server sends out only a single stream that is common to all users. Therefore, such a stream would only use 300 kbit/s of server bandwidth. youtubeRecommended bitrate setting ranges are based on video ingestion resolution and frame rate. These recommendations are the same for AV1 and HEVC. an estimation on the usage in different resolutions240p: 225MB per hour360p: 315MB per hour480p: 562.5MB per hour720p at 30FPS: 1237.5MB (1.24GB) per hour720p at 60FPS: 1856.25MB (1.86GB) per hour1080p at 30FPS: 2.03GB per hour1080p at 60FPS: 3.04GB per hour1440p (2K) at 30FPS: 4.28GB per hour1440p (2K) at 60FPS: 6.08GB per hour2160p (4K) at 30FPS: 10.58GB per hour2160p (4K) at 60FPS: 15.98GB per hour These calculations are based on YouTubes data and has been calculated according to this. For 480p video (standard quality), YouTube recommends a bitrate between 500 and 2,000Kbps. Let’s average these two extremes and use 1,250Kbps. 1,250Kbps (kilobits per second) divided by 1,000 gives us 1.25Mbps (megabits per second). Since there are eight bits in one byte, 1.25Mbps divided by eight equals roughly 0.156 megabytes per second of video. Multiplying this by 60 seconds means that 480p video uses around 9.375MB of data per minute on YouTube. “9.375MB per minute times 60 minutes in an hour results in roughly 562.5MB of data per hour of YouTube streaming at 480p.”","link":"/lucfe-hexo/0004%20Formal%20science/%E8%AE%A1%E7%AE%97%E6%9C%BA%E7%A7%91%E5%AD%A6%E6%8A%80%E6%9C%AF%20Computer%20science/Applied%20computing/streaming/"},{"title":"","text":"国内公共DNS DoH/DoT/DoQDOT DNS over TLS (DoT) is a network security protocol for encrypting and wrapping Domain Name System (DNS) queries and answers via the Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocol.

Based on the 802.11i standard, WPA2 provides thestrongest protection for consumer-grade wireless networks. It uses 802.1x-based authentication and Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) encryption; combined, these technologies ensure that only authorized users can access the network and that any intercepteddata cannot be deciphered. WPA2 comes in two flavors: WPA2-Personal and WPA2-Enterprise. WPA2-Personal uses a passphrase to create its encryption keys and is currently thebest available security for wireless networks in homes and small offices. WPA2-Enterpriserequires a server to verify network users. All wireless products sold since early 2006 mustsupport WPA2 to bear the Wi-Fi CERTIFIED label.● Wi-Fi Protected Access (WPA). WPA is an earlier version of the encryption schemethat has since been replaced by WPA2. It was specifically designed to overcome weaknesses of WEP. On a small network that uses WPA, clients and access points use a sharednetwork password (called a preshared key, or PSK) that consists of a 256-bit number ora passphrase that is from 8 to 63 bytes long. (A longer passphrase produces a strongerkey.) With a sufficiently strong key based on a truly random sequence, the likelihood of asuccessful outside attack is slim.

(abc){2,}abc出现的次数必须大于等于2 捕获组使用捕获组复用模式 正则表达式中的字符串模式多次出现，手动重复输入这些正则表达式是浪费时间的。有一个更好的方法可以用于你的字符串中有多个重复子串时进行指定，这个方法就是捕获组。 用括号”()”可以定义捕获组，用于查找重复的子串，即把会重复的字符串模式的正则表达式放在括号内。 要指定重复字符串出现的位置，可以使用反斜线”&quot; + 数字的形式。该数字从1开始，并随着用括号定义的捕获组数量而增加。比如\\1匹配正则表达式中通过括号定义的第一个捕获组。 使用捕获组来匹配字符串中连续出现3次的数字，每个数字由空格分隔，正则表达式为 (\\d+)\\s\\1\\s\\1 \\1代表捕获组(\\d+)内正则表达式匹配的结果，而不是正则表达式\\d+。因此，这个正则表示可以匹配123 123 123，但是不能匹配120 210 220。 （注意：是先捕获后复用，即先执行表达式得到结果之后再复用） 在替换中使用捕获组复用模式如果我们在搜索替换中希望保留搜索字符串中的某些字符串作为替换字符串的一部分，可以使用”$”符号访问搜索字符串中的捕获组。 比如，在搜索正则表达式中的捕获组为capture groups，则替换的正则表达式中可以直接使用$1复用搜索正则表达式中的捕获组capture groups。 在VSCode中，如果想要把项目中所有的HTML标签中的h改为H，搜索正则表达式&lt;h(\\d)&gt;就可以查找出所有标签，如&lt;h1&gt;、&lt;h2&gt;、&lt;h3&gt;、&lt;h4&gt;等，其中还定义了捕获组(\\d)。 替换的正则表达式&lt;H$1&gt;使用$1复用了搜索正则表达式中定义的捕获组(\\d)，如下图所示。 (pattern)匹配 pattern 并获取这一匹配。所获取的匹配可以从产生的 Matches 集合得到，在VBScript 中使用 SubMatches 集合，在JScript 中则使用 $0…$9 属性。要匹配圆括号字符，请使用 ‘(‘ 或 ‘)‘。 (?:pattern)匹配 pattern 但不获取匹配结果，也就是说这是一个非获取匹配，不进行存储供以后使用。 这在使用 “或” 字符 (|) 来组合一个模式的各个部分是很有用。例如， ‘industr(?:y|ies) 就是一个比 ‘industry|industries’ 更简略的表达式。 (?=pattern)正向肯定预查（look ahead positive assert），在任何匹配pattern的字符串开始处匹配查找字符串。 这是一个非获取匹配，也就是说，该匹配不需要获取供以后使用。 例如，”Windows(?=95|98|NT|2000)”能匹配”Windows2000”中的”Windows”，但不能匹配”Windows3.1”中的”Windows”。 预查不消耗字符，也就是说，在一个匹配发生后，在最后一次匹配之后立即开始下一次匹配的搜索，而不是从包含预查的字符之后开始。","link":"/lucfe-hexo/0004%20Formal%20science/%E8%AE%A1%E7%AE%97%E6%9C%BA%E7%A7%91%E5%AD%A6%E6%8A%80%E6%9C%AF%20Computer%20science/Software%20notations%C2%A0and%C2%A0tools/Regex%E6%AD%A3%E5%88%99%E8%A1%A8%E8%BE%BE%E5%BC%8F/"},{"title":"","text":"VS2015发布安装包1编译工程 编写并调试你的工程，保证工程能编译运行 2查看框架 项目 -&gt; xx属性(P)… -&gt; 应用程序 查看目标框架（修改后请重新编译工程以确保可行性） 生成 生成 -&gt; 配置选择release 创建数字签名证书（已有可跳过此步） 使用OFFICE工具下的VBA项目的数字证书工具生成一个证书 或自行搜索数字证书生成方法 签名 签名 -&gt; 选中为clickonce清单签名 -&gt; 从存储区选择 发布准备 发布 -&gt; 发布文件夹位置（生成的安装包的位置） 发布 -&gt; 应用程序文件（查看需要打包的文件） 发布 -&gt; 系统必备组件（选择需要安装的必备组件） 发布 -&gt; 选项（设置发布语言，发行者名称等） 发布 -&gt; 发布版本（就是版本号） 准备系统必备组件（以 .NET Framework 4.5.2为例） 发布 -&gt; 系统必备组件 选中 创建用于安装系统必备组件的安装程序 选中 Microsoft .NET Framework 4.5.2 (x86 和 x64) 选中 从与我的应用程序相同的位置下载系统必备组件 准备系统必备组件安装包（以 .NET Framework 4.5.2为例） 点击立即发布 在错误列表中查看缺失的安装包 从网上下载对应的离线安装包 微软下载https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/search/DownloadResults.aspx?FORM=DLC&amp;ftapplicableproducts=%5e%22AllDownloads%22&amp;sortby=+weight&amp;q=developer+software 准备系统必备组件安装包（以 .NET Framework 4.5.2为例） 离线安装包下载完后 把英文版安装包（ENU）拷贝到 %VS安装目录%\\SDK\\Bootstrapper\\Packages\\DotNetFX452\\ 把语言包（CNS等）拷贝到 %VS安装目录%\\SDK\\Bootstrapper\\Packages\\DotNetFX452\\zh-Hans（或其他对应语言）\\ *默认VS安装目录为 C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Microsoft Visual Studio 14.0 准备系统必备组件安装包（以 .NET Framework 4.5.2为例） 再次点击立即发布 如果有以下警告，可参照下一步 也可以忽略警告，跳过下一步 特性值不匹配警告（以 .NET Framework 4.5.2为例） 右键英文版安装包 -&gt; 属性 -&gt; 数字签名 -&gt; 选中列表 -&gt; 详细信息 -&gt; 查看证书 -&gt; 详细信息 -&gt; 公钥 -&gt; 复制内容到文本文档并删除空格 右键编辑英文版安装包位置下 %VS安装目录%\\SDK\\Bootstrapper\\Packages\\DotNetFX452\\product.xml 用上述公钥内容替换掉PublicKey的值 中文语言包安装包操作方法同上 发布 点击立即发布 发布成功后，你就可以把整个发布文件夹打包发给别人安装了 Application Files 文件夹内存放有所有历史版本的信息，你可以把旧版本的文件夹删除，只保留最新的版本文件夹 dotnetfx452 文件夹内存放的是系统必备组件安装包 setup.exe 就是安装程序","link":"/lucfe-hexo/0004%20Formal%20science/%E8%AE%A1%E7%AE%97%E6%9C%BA%E7%A7%91%E5%AD%A6%E6%8A%80%E6%9C%AF%20Computer%20science/Software%20notations%C2%A0and%C2%A0tools/Visual%20Studio%202015%E5%8F%91%E5%B8%83%E5%AE%89%E8%A3%85%E5%8C%85/"},{"title":"git wiki","text":"Commits are shown in green as 5-character IDs, and they point to their parents. Branches are shown in orange, and they point to particular commits. The current branch is identified by the special reference HEAD, which is “attached” to that branch. In this image, the five latest commits are shown, with ed489 being the most recent. main (the current branch) points to this commit, while stable (another branch) points to an ancestor of main’s commit. How does Git know what branch you’re currently on? It keeps a special pointer called HEAD. git basicTypically, you’ll want to start making changes and committing snapshots of those changes into your repository each time the project reaches a state you want to record. each file in your working directory can be in one of two states: tracked or untracked. Tracked files are files that were in the last snapshot, as well as any newly staged files; they can be unmodified, modified, or staged.In short, tracked files are files that Git knows about. Untracked files are everything else — any files in your working directory that were not in your last snapshot and are not in your staging area. When you first clone a repository, all of your files will be tracked and unmodified because Git just checked them out and you haven’t edited anything. As you edit files, Git sees them as modified, because you’ve changed them since your last commit. As you work, you selectively stage these modified files and then commit all those staged changes, and the cycle repeats. Checking the Status of Your FilesThe main tool you use to determine which files are in which state is the git status command. If you run this command directly after a clone, you should see something like this: 1234567891011121314151617$ git statusOn branch mainYour branch is ahead of 'origin/main' by 1 commit. (use &quot;git push&quot; to publish your local commits)Changes to be committed: (use &quot;git restore --staged &lt;file&gt;...&quot; to unstage) new file: _posts/category level1/category level2/git wiki.mdChanges not staged for commit: (use &quot;git add &lt;file&gt;...&quot; to update what will be committed) (use &quot;git restore &lt;file&gt;...&quot; to discard changes in working directory) modified: _posts/category level1/category level2/temp002.mdUntracked files: (use &quot;git add &lt;file&gt;...&quot; to include in what will be committed) assets/images/git wiki/ Tracking New FilesIn order to begin tracking a new file, you use the command git add. To begin tracking the README file, you can run this: $ git add README Staging Modified Files “Changes not staged for commit” — which means that a file that is tracked has been modified in the working directory but not yet staged. To stage it, you run the git add command. git add is a multipurpose command — you use it to begin tracking new files, to stage files, and to do other things like marking merge-conflicted files as resolved. It may be helpful to think of it more as “add precisely this content to the next commit” rather than “add this file to the project”. Git stages a file exactly as it is when you run the git add command. If you commit now, the version of CONTRIBUTING.md as it was when you last ran the git add command is how it will go into the commit, not the version of the file as it looks in your working directory when you run git commit. If you modify a file after you run git add, you have to run git add again to stage the latest version of the file: Ignoring FilesOften, you’ll have a class of files that you don’t want Git to automatically add or even show you as being untracked. These are generally automatically generated files such as log files or files produced by your build system. In such cases, you can create a file listing patterns to match them named .gitignore. Setting up a .gitignore file for your new repository before you get going is generally a good idea so you don’t accidentally commit files that you really don’t want in your Git repository. The rules for the patterns you can put in the .gitignore file are as follows: Blank lines or lines starting with # are ignored. Standard glob patterns work, and will be applied recursively throughout the entire working tree. You can start patterns with a forward slash / to avoid recursivity. You can end patterns with a forward slash / to specify a directory. You can negate a pattern by starting it with an exclamation point !. 1234567891011121314151617# ignore all .a files*.a# but do track lib.a, even though you're ignoring .a files above!lib.a# only ignore the TODO file in the current directory, not subdir/TODO/TODO# ignore all files in any directory named buildbuild/# ignore doc/notes.txt, but not doc/server/arch.txtdoc/*.txt# ignore all .pdf files in the doc/ directory and any of its subdirectoriesdoc/**/*.pdf Viewing Your Staged and Unstaged ChangesIf the git status command is too vague for you — you want to know exactly what you changed, not just which files were changed — you can use the git diff command. Committing Your ChangesNow that your staging area is set up the way you want it, you can commit your changes. Remember that anything that is still unstaged — any files you have created or modified that you haven’t run git add on since you edited them — won’t go into this commit. They will stay as modified files on your disk. Alternatively, you can type your commit message inline with the commit command by specifying it after a -m flag, like this: $ git commit -m &quot;Story 182: fix benchmarks for speed&quot; Removing FilesTo remove a file from Git, you have to remove it from your tracked files (more accurately, remove it from your staging area) and then commit. The git rm command does that, and also removes the file from your working directory so you don’t see it as an untracked file the next time around. If you simply remove the file from your working directory, it shows up under the “Changes not staged for commit” Then, if you run git rm, it stages the file’s removal: Another useful thing you may want to do is to keep the file in your working tree but remove it from your staging area. In other words, you may want to keep the file on your hard drive but not have Git track it anymore. This is particularly useful if you forgot to add something to your .gitignore file and accidentally staged it, like a large log file or a bunch of .a compiled files. To do this, use the –cached option: $ git rm --cached README You can pass files, directories, and file-glob patterns to the git rm command. That means you can do things such as: $ git rm log/\\*.log Note the backslash \\ in front of the *. This is necessary because Git does its own filename expansion in addition to your shell’s filename expansion. This command removes all files that have the .log extension in the log/ directory. If you rename a file in Git, no metadata is stored in Git that tells it you renamed the file. However, Git is pretty smart about figuring that out after the fact $ git mv file_from file_to However, this is equivalent to running something like this: $ mv README.md README$ git rm README.md$ git add READMEGit figures out that it’s a rename implicitly, so it doesn’t matter if you rename a file that way or with the mv command. you can use any tool you like to rename a file, and address the add/rm later, before you commit. github git vsCode proxy setting vsCode setting 123&quot;http.proxyAuthorization&quot;: null,&quot;http.proxy&quot;: &quot;http://127.0.0.1:8000&quot;,&quot;https.proxy&quot;: &quot;http://127.0.0.1:8000&quot; git bash command 12git config -global http.proxy http://127.0.0.1:8000git config -global https.proxy http://127.0.0.1:8000 basic commands The four commands above copy files between the working directory, the stage (also called the index), and the history (in the form of commits). git add files copies files (at their current state) to the stage. git commit saves a snapshot of the stage as a commit. git reset – files unstages files; that is, it copies files from the latest commit to the stage. Use this command to “undo” a git add files. You can also git reset to unstage everything. git checkout -- *files* copies files from the stage to the working directory. Use this to throw away local changes. ou can use git reset -p, git checkout -p, or git add -p instead of (or in addition to) specifying particular files to interactively choose which hunks copy. It is also possible to jump over the stage and check out files directly from the history or commit files without staging first. git commit -a is equivalent to running git add on all filenames that existed in the latest commit, and then running git commit. git commit *files* creates a new commit containing the contents of the latest commit, plus a snapshot of files taken from the working directory. Additionally, files are copied to the stage.git checkout HEAD -- *files* copies files from the latest commit to both the stage and the working directory. git diffThere are various ways to look at differences between commits. Below are some common examples. Any of these commands can optionally take extra filename arguments that limit the differences to the named files. git commitWhen you commit, git creates a new commit object using the files from the stage and sets the parent to the current commit. It then points the current branch to this new commit. In the image below, the current branch is main. Before the command was run, main pointed to ed489. Afterward, a new commit, f0cec, was created, with parent ed489, and then main was moved to the new commit. This same process happens even when the current branch is an ancestor of another. Below, a commit occurs on branch stable, which was an ancestor of main, resulting in 1800b. Afterward, stable is no longer an ancestor of main. To join the two histories, a merge (or rebase) will be necessary. Sometimes a mistake is made in a commit, but this is easy to correct with git commit –amend. When you use this command, git creates a new commit with the same parent as the current commit. (The old commit will be discarded if nothing else references it.) git branchgit branch name will create a new branch named “name”. Creating branches just creates a new tag pointing to the currently checked out commit. git checkoutgit checkout has many uses, but the main one is to switch between branches.For example, to switch from master branch to dev branch, I would type git checkout dev. The checkout command is used to copy files from the history (or stage) to the working directory, and to optionally switch branches. When a filename is not given but the reference is a (local) branch, HEAD is moved to that branch (that is, we “switch to” that branch), and then the stage and working directory are set to match the contents of that commit. Any file that exists in the new commit (a47c3 below) is copied; any file that exists in the old commit (ed489) but not in the new one is deleted; and any file that exists in neither is ignored. When a filename is not given and the reference is not a (local) branch — say, it is a tag, a remote branch, a SHA-1 ID, or something like main~3 — we get an anonymous branch, called a detached HEAD. This is useful for jumping around the history. Say you want to compile version 1.6.6.1 of git. You can git checkout v1.6.6.1 (which is a tag, not a branch), compile, install, and then switch back to another branch, say git checkout main. However, committing works slightly differently with a detached HEAD; this is covered below. When a filename (and/or -p) is given, git copies those files from the given commit to the stage and the working directory. For example, git checkout HEAD~ foo.c copies the file foo.c from the commit called HEAD~ (the parent of the current commit) to the working directory, and also stages it. (If no commit name is given, files are copied from the stage.) Note that the current branch is not changed. When HEAD is detached, commits work like normal, except no named branch gets updated. (You can think of this as an anonymous branch.) Once you check out something else, say main, the commit is (presumably) no longer referenced by anything else, and gets lost. Note that after the command, there is nothing referencing 2eecb. In addition to checking out branches, you can also checkout individual commits. git checkout bb92e0egit commitNot a good idea to make commits while in a detached HEAD state. git checkout bb92e0egit branch branchname1git commit You can combine git branch and git checkout into a single command by typing git checkout -b branchname. This will create the branch if it does not already exist and immediately check it out.when you commit, the HEAD is the new branch. undo commitgit resetgit reset will move HEAD and the current branch back to wherever you specify, abandoning any commits that may be left behind. This is useful to undo a commit that you no longer need. This command is normally used with one of three flags: “–soft”, “–mixed”, and “–hard”. The soft and mixed flags deal with what to do with the work that was inside the commit after you reset, and you can read about it here. Since this visualization cannot graphically display that work, only the “–hard” flag will work on this site. The ref “HEAD^” is usually used together with this command. “HEAD^” means “the commit right before HEAD. “HEAD^^” means “two commits before HEAD”, and so on. !!Note that you must never use git reset to abandon commits that have already been pushed and merged into the origin. This can cause your local repository to become out of sync with the origin. Don’t do it unless you really know what you’re doing. The reset command moves the current branch to another position, and optionally updates the stage and the working directory. It also is used to copy files from the history to the stage without touching the working directory. If a commit is given with no filenames, the current branch is moved to that commit, and then the stage is updated to match this commit. If –hard is given, the working directory is also updated. If –soft is given, neither is updated. If a commit is not given, it defaults to HEAD. In this case, the branch is not moved, but the stage (and optionally the working directory, if –hard is given) are reset to the contents of the last commit. git revertTo undo commits that have already been pushed and shared with the team, we cannot use the git reset command. Instead, we have to use git revert. git revert will create a new commit that will undo all of the work that was done in the commit you want to revert. combine branchesgit mergegit merge will create a new commit with two parents. The resulting commit snapshot will have the all of the work that has been done in both branches. If there was no divergence between the two commits, git will do a “fast-forward” method merge. A merge creates a new commit that incorporates changes from other commits. Before merging, the stage must match the current commit. The trivial case is if the other commit is an ancestor of the current commit, in which case nothing is done. The next most simple is if the current commit is an ancestor of the other commit. This results in a fast-forward merge. The reference is simply moved, and then the new commit is checked out. Otherwise, a “real” merge must occur. You can choose other strategies, but the default is to perform a “recursive” merge, which basically takes the current commit (ed489 below), the other commit (33104), and their common ancestor (b325c), and performs a three-way merge. The result is saved to the working directory and the stage, and then a commit occurs, with an extra parent (33104) for the new commit. “git merge” used to allow merging two branches that have no common base by default, which led to a brand new history of an existing project created and then get pulled by an unsuspecting maintainer, which allowed an unnecessary parallel history merged into the existing project. The command has been taught not to allow this by default, with an escape hatch –allow-unrelated-histories option to be used in a rare event that merges histories of two projects that started their lives independently. git rebasegit rebase will take the commits on this branch and “move” them so that their new “base” is at the point you specify. The reason I put “move” in quotations because this process actually generates brand new commits with completely different IDs than the old commits, and leaves the old commits where they were. For this reason, you never want to rebase commits that have already been shared with the team you are working with. A rebase is an alternative to a merge for combining multiple branches. Whereas a merge creates a single commit with two parents, leaving a non-linear history, a rebase replays the commits from the current branch onto another, leaving a linear history. In essence, this is an automated way of performing several cherry-picks in a row. The above command takes all the commits that exist in topic but not in main (namely 169a6 and 2c33a), replays them onto main, and then moves the branch head to the new tip. Note that the old commits will be garbage collected if they are no longer referenced. remote server Showing Your RemotesTo see which remote servers you have configured, you can run the git remote command. It lists the shortnames of each remote handle you’ve specified. If you’ve cloned your repository, you should at least see origin — that is the default name Git gives to the server you cloned from: 12345678910$ git clone https://github.com/schacon/ticgitCloning into 'ticgit'...remote: Reusing existing pack: 1857, done.remote: Total 1857 (delta 0), reused 0 (delta 0)Receiving objects: 100% (1857/1857), 374.35 KiB | 268.00 KiB/s, done.Resolving deltas: 100% (772/772), done.Checking connectivity... done.$ cd ticgit$ git remoteorigin You can also specify -v, which shows you the URLs that Git has stored for the shortname to be used when reading and writing to that remote: $ git remote -vorigin https://github.com/schacon/ticgit (fetch)origin https://github.com/schacon/ticgit (push) Adding Remote RepositoriesWe’ve mentioned and given some demonstrations of how the git clone command implicitly adds the origin remote for you. Here’s how to add a new remote explicitly. To add a new remote Git repository as a shortname you can reference easily, run git remote add &lt;shortname&gt; &lt;url&gt;: 12345678$ git remoteorigin$ git remote add pb https://github.com/paulboone/ticgit$ git remote -vorigin https://github.com/schacon/ticgit (fetch)origin https://github.com/schacon/ticgit (push)pb https://github.com/paulboone/ticgit (fetch)pb https://github.com/paulboone/ticgit (push) if you want to fetch all the information that Paul has but that you don’t yet have in your repository, you can run git fetch pb: 12345678 $ git fetch pbremote: Counting objects: 43, done.remote: Compressing objects: 100% (36/36), done.remote: Total 43 (delta 10), reused 31 (delta 5)Unpacking objects: 100% (43/43), done.From https://github.com/paulboone/ticgit * [new branch] master -&gt; pb/master * [new branch] ticgit -&gt; pb/ticgit Paul’s master branch is now accessible locally as pb/master — you can merge it into one of your branches, or you can check out a local branch at that point if you want to inspect it. git fetchAs you just saw, to get data from your remote projects, you can run: $ git fetch &lt;remote&gt; git fetch will update all of the “remote tracking branches” in your local repository. Remote tracking branches are tagged in grey. It’s important to note that the git fetch command only downloads the data to your local repository — it doesn’t automatically merge it with any of your work or modify what you’re currently working on. You have to merge it manually into your work when you’re ready. git pullA git pull is a two step process that first does a git fetch, and then does a git merge of the remote tracking branch associated with your current branch. If you have no current branch, the process will stop after fetching. If your current branch is set up to track a remote branch, you can use the git pull command to automatically fetch and then merge that remote branch into your current branch. If you have a tracking branch set up as demonstrated in the last section, either by explicitly setting it or by having it created for you by the clone or checkout commands, git pull will look up what server and branch your current branch is tracking, fetch from that server and then try to merge in that remote branch. Tracking branches are local branches that have a direct relationship to a remote branch. If you’re on a tracking branch and type git pull, Git automatically knows which server to fetch from and which branch to merge in. If you clone a repository, the command automatically adds that remote repository under the name “origin” by default, the git clone command automatically sets up your local master branch to track the remote master branch (or whatever the default branch is called) you can set up other tracking branches if you wish — ones that track branches on other remotes, or don’t track the master branch. The simple case is the example you just saw, running git checkout -b &lt;branch&gt; &lt;remote&gt;/&lt;branch&gt;. $ git checkout -b sf origin/serverfixBranch sf set up to track remote branch serverfix from origin.Switched to a new branch ‘sf’Now, your local branch sf will automatically pull from origin/serverfix. If you already have a local branch and want to set it to a remote branch you just pulled down, or want to change the upstream branch you’re tracking, you can use the -u or –set-upstream-to option to git branch to explicitly set it at any time. $ git branch -u origin/serverfixBranch serverfix set up to track remote branch serverfix from origin. If you want to see what tracking branches you have set up, you can use the -vv option to git branch. This will list out your local branches with more information including what each branch is tracking and if your local branch is ahead, behind or both. 1234567hint: If you are planning on basing your work on an upstreamhint: branch that already exists at the remote, you may need tohint: run &quot;git fetch&quot; to retrieve it.hint:hint: If you are planning to push out a new local branch thathint: will track its remote counterpart, you may want to usehint: &quot;git push -u&quot; to set the upstream config as you push. 1234$ git pushfatal: The current branch newbrachname has no upstream branch.To push the current branch and set the remote as upstream, use git push --set-upstream origin newbrachname 12345$ git branch -vv iss53 7e424c3 [origin/iss53: ahead 2] Add forgotten brackets master 1ae2a45 [origin/master] Deploy index fix* serverfix f8674d9 [teamone/server-fix-good: ahead 3, behind 1] This should do it testing 5ea463a Try something new So here we can see that our iss53 branch is tracking origin/iss53 and is “ahead” by two, meaning that we have two commits locally that are not pushed to the server.We can also see that our master branch is tracking origin/master and is up to date.Next we can see that our serverfix branch is tracking the server-fix-good branch on our teamone server and is ahead by three and behind by one, meaning that there is one commit on the server we haven’t merged in yet and three commits locally that we haven’t pushed.Finally we can see that our testing branch is not tracking any remote branch. It’s important to note that these numbers are only since the last time you fetched from each server. This command does not reach out to the servers, it’s telling you about what it has cached from these servers locally. If you want totally up to date ahead and behind numbers, you’ll need to fetch from all your remotes right before running this. You could do that like this: $ git fetch --all; git branch -vv git pushA git push will find the commits you have on your local branch that the corresponding branch on the origin server does not have, and send them to the remote repository. By default, all pushes must cause a fast-forward merge on the remote repository. If there is any divergence between your local branch and the remote branch, your push will be rejected. In this scenario, you need to pull first and then you will be able to push again. If you have a branch named serverfix that you want to work on with others, you can push it up the same way you pushed your first branch. Run git push : $ git push origin serverfix You can also do git push origin serverfix:serverfix, which does the same thing — it says, “Take my serverfix and make it the remote’s serverfix.” You can use this format to push a local branch into a remote branch that is named differently. If you didn’t want it to be called serverfix on the remote, you could instead run git push origin serverfix:awesomebranch to push your local serverfix branch to the awesomebranch branch on the remote project. exampleyou have a Git server on your network at git.ourcompany.com. If you clone from this, Git’s clone command automatically names it origin for you, pulls down all its data, creates a pointer to where its master branch is, and names it origin/master locally. Git also gives you your own local master branch starting at the same place as origin’s master branch, so you have something to work from. If you do some work on your local master branch, and, in the meantime, someone else pushes to git.ourcompany.com and updates its master branch, then your histories move forward differently. Also, as long as you stay out of contact with your origin server, your origin/master pointer doesn’t move. To synchronize your work with a given remote, you run a git fetch &lt;remote&gt; command (in our case, git fetch origin). This command looks up which server “origin” is (in this case, it’s git.ourcompany.com), fetches any data from it that you don’t yet have, and updates your local database, moving your origin/master pointer to its new, more up-to-date position. you have another internal Git server that is used only for development by one of your sprint teams. This server is at git.team1.ourcompany.com. You can add it as a new remote reference to the project you’re currently working on by running the git remote add command.Name this remote teamone, which will be your shortname for that whole URL. Now, you can run git fetch teamone to fetch everything the remote teamone server has that you don’t have yet. Because that server has a subset of the data your origin server has right now, Git fetches no data but sets a remote-tracking branch called teamone/master to point to the commit that teamone has as its master branch. It’s important to note that when you do a fetch that brings down new remote-tracking branches, you don’t automatically have local, editable copies of them. In other words, in this case, you don’t have a new serverfix branch — you have only an origin/serverfix pointer that you can’t modify. To merge this work into your current working branch, you can run git merge origin/serverfix. If you want your own serverfix branch that you can work on, you can base it off your remote-tracking branch: $ git checkout -b serverfix origin/serverfixBranch serverfix set up to track remote branch serverfix from origin.Switched to a new branch ‘serverfix’This gives you a local branch that you can work on that starts where origin/serverfix is. How to create a new repository which is a clone of another repository There’s probably several ways to do this, including a smarter one, but this is how I would do this: Make a new repo on Github called SecondProject.Locally clone your MyfirstProject, either from disk or from Github. Then use git pull on the branches you need to move to the second repo. git remote set-url origin git@github.com:yourname/SecondProject.git Push it.Note that the clone retains a shared history with MyfirstProject, which is useful if you change your mind about the “never merge” bit. 1. Clone your MyfirstProject to your local machine.Delete .git foldergit initPublish your new project

双碳，即碳达峰与碳中和的简称碳达峰（peak carbon dioxide emissions） [11] 就是指在某一个时点，二氧化碳的排放不再增长达到峰值，之后逐步回落 [3] 。碳达峰是二氧化碳排放量由增转降的历史拐点，标志着碳排放与经济发展实现脱钩，达峰目标包括达峰年份和峰值碳中和（carbon neutrality），节能减排术语。碳中和是指国家、企业、产品、活动或个人在一定时间内直接或间接产生的二氧化碳或温室气体排放总量，通过植树造林、节能减排等形式，以抵消自身产生的二氧化碳或温室气体排放量，实现正负抵消，达到相对“零排放”。 “特钢又被称为特种钢或特殊钢，专指由于成分、结构、生产工艺特殊而具有特殊物理、化学性能或者特殊用途的钢铁产品”高端、特种装备制造领域 “钢铁是钢和铁的合称。根据国家标准《钢分类》，钢是指以铁为主要元素，含碳量一般在2%以下，并含有其他元素的材料，如硅、锰、磷、硫等，故又被称为铁碳合金。” 钢铁的性能一般分为力学性能1、化学性能2和工艺性能3。其中力学性能也称机械性能，是钢材最重要的使用性能，包括强度4、硬度5、塑性6和韧性7。力学性能是指钢材在不同环境（温度、介质、湿度）下，承受各种外加载荷（拉伸、压缩、弯曲、扭转、冲击、交变应力等）时所表现出的力学特性。强度指材料抗变形或断裂的能力，强度越高，钢材承受力越大。硬度指材料表面抗硬物压力能力，硬度越高，说明钢的耐磨性越好，即不容易磨损。塑性指材料发生变形而不断裂的能力，塑性越高，说明钢材的延展性越好，即容易拉丝或轧板。韧性也叫冲击韧性，指材料抵抗冲击变形的能力，韧性越高，说明钢材抵抗运动载荷的能力越强。 化学性能是指钢材与周围介质扫触时抵抗发生化学或电化学反应的性能。工艺性能是指钢材承受各种加工、处理的能力。碳是决定钢铁机械性能的主要元素，含碳量越高，钢铁的硬度越高，但为了保持其强度、韧性和塑性，含碳量一般不超过 1.7%。而硫、磷、氧、氮多对钢铁性能有所损害，如硫含量越高，钢铁的韧性、耐腐蚀性和可焊性越低，需严格控制其含量。根据化学性能的不同，可将钢铁分为非合金钢、低合金钢、合金钢三大类合金钢可根据主要使用特性分为工程结构用钢、机械结构用钢、不锈、耐蚀和耐热钢、工具钢、轴承钢、特殊物理性能钢和其他。特殊物理性能钢，在钢的定义范围内具有特殊磁性、电性、弹性、膨胀性等物理特性的钢，包括软磁钢、永磁钢、无磁钢以及特殊弹性钢、特殊膨胀钢、高电阻钢和合金等。按照质量等级从低到高又可将这三类钢铁分别分为普通、优质和特殊三大类。从制钢流程来分，可将钢铁分为生铁、粗钢和钢材三大类。生铁，又称“铁水”，是铁矿石经高炉冶炼的产品，根据碳存在形式不同可分为白口铁、灰口铁和球墨铸铁9；粗钢，即钢坯，是由生铁氧化加工或废钢经过电弧炉等设备提纯，将含碳量和其他元素降到规定范围，符合最终钢材所要求的化学成分的钢水；钢材是粗钢通过铸、扎、锻、挤等工艺加工而成的各种形状、尺寸和性能的产品。根据断面形状的不同，一般分为线材、型材、板材、管材和金属制品等类型。白口铁中的碳以碳化铁的形式存在，断面呈白色，坚硬而脆，通常用于炼钢；灰口铁中的碳以片状石墨的形式存在，断面为灰色，具有良好的切削、耐磨和铸造性能，主要用于各种铸件；球墨铸铁中的碳以球状石墨的形态存在，其机械性能远胜于灰口铁而接近于钢，主要用于韧性、强度要求高的铸件。 球炼铁主要方法包括高炉法、熔融还原法、直接还原法等。其中高炉法是现代炼铁的主要方式，即以铁矿石为原料、焦炭为燃料和还原剂，经过高温将铁矿石还原成液态生铁，并除去有害元素硫。“炼钢分为转炉炼钢和平炉炼钢两大类，其中转炉炼钢为全球主流工艺，即以铁水为原料，废钢作为冷却剂，通入氧气，并除去多余的碳、磷和剩余的硫，制成粗钢。按照性能要求，还可添加适量的硅锰等合金元素。”短流程不需制铁，可直接用电弧炉将废钢冶炼为粗钢。废钢为主要原材料，经破碎、分装后装入电炉，利用石墨电极与废钢之间产生电弧所发生的热量来熔炼废钢，通过脱气等流程后得到合格钢水。我国长流程粗钢产量占比约 89.4%，高出世界平均水平高18.6BP；短流程炼钢的主要原材料为废钢，但我国工业起步较晚，废钢资源较少，导致废钢成本较高。长流程吨钢耗电量较少。电弧炉炼钢依靠电力产热使废铁熔化，而高炉炼铁则主要由焦炭提供热量，转炉炼钢则通过铁液本身的物理热和组分之间的化学反应产生热量，因此吨钢耗电较少。无论是长流程炼钢还是短流程炼钢，原材料的波动基本与钢材价格一致。铁矿石是长流程炼钢最主要的原材料。铁矿石占长流程炼钢成本的 47%，根据含铁矿物种类，可将常用于炼铁的铁矿石分为磁铁矿、赤铁矿、褐铁矿和菱铁矿全球铁矿石原矿储量 180012亿吨，其中澳大利亚 500 亿吨（27.8%）、巴西 340 亿吨（18.9%）、俄罗斯250 亿吨（13.9%）、中国 200 亿吨（11.1%），四国储量占全球总量的71.7%。世界铁矿资源整体品位较高，平均品位为 46.7%.我国铁矿石品位仅为 34.5%，低于全球平均品位。2020 年，全球铁矿石出口量16.6 亿吨，其中澳大利亚铁矿石出口 8.7 亿吨，巴西出口 3.4 亿吨，占全球铁矿石总出口量的 73.4%。我国铁矿石进口依赖度高，主要进口国为澳大利亚。进口铁矿的价格大多低于国产铁矿的价格..进口矿价格优势来自于两方面：一方面，由于我国铁矿埋藏较深，采矿成本远高于国外。国内铁矿石开采成本（不含运费）约为 80美元/吨，而海外大型企业仅为 20-30 美元/吨；另一方面，我国选矿成本要高于国外。由于我国多贫矿，不能直接用于高炉炼铁，需要经过选矿、人工造块等流程后品位才能与进口矿相当，与富矿相比需要花费更多的选矿成本。根据废钢来源，可分为社会采购废钢14、自产废钢15和进口废钢。社会采购废钢包括加工废钢和折旧废钢。加工废钢是钢材下游的制造商，如汽车、家电、机械等制造商，在生产装配过程中产生的废钢；折旧废钢指各种钢铁制品使用寿命到期后，报废产生的废旧钢铁。 自产废钢也称内部废钢，指钢厂在生产、轧材过程中产生的切头、切尾、切屑、边角料等，是钢铁生产企业自用，不参与社会流通的废钢。““地条钢16”出清，释放我国长期被地条钢挤占的废钢资源”表观消费量是指当年产量加上净进口量（当年进口量减出口量）。特点是较易取得相关数据。钢材的表观消费量，就是钢材的全国产量加上净进口量的总和，但是这些钢材可能并不全都被消费掉了，要扣减其他损耗和仓储等等才是真实的实际消费量。废钢价格显著高于铁矿石价格建筑业和制造业是消费两大支柱，房地产是驱动钢铁消费变化的主要行业。建筑业包括基建和地产，制造业包括机械、汽车、家电、造船、集装箱和能源化工等。地产、基建和机械是钢铁下游消费的主要领域，三者占比占整体消费的七成以上。房地产消费占比最高，2021 年占比为 36.5%；其次为基建和机械，占比分别为 21.1%和 16.1%。产能等量或减量置换就是对于钢铁、水泥等产能过剩行业，必须首先通过在全国或某一个区域（集团公司）内淘汰落后产能、整合重组原有企业，把落后产能或技术含量比较低的产能淘汰，之后再增加新产能，新建、扩建项目新增产能应等于或小于淘汰的产能，只有在减少或不增加产能的前提下才能审批新的建设项目，原则上不再核准和支持单纯扩大产能的项目。对外购铁矿石依赖度高的钢铁厂更倾向于建设在毗邻深水码头的沿海地区。举例来说，江苏省本土几乎没有铁矿石资源，但受益于沿江港口的优势，粗钢产量位于全国第二位；进出口对我国总需求和总供给的影响较小。2021 年我国钢材出口需求仅占总需求的 6.5%；从供给端来看，2021 年我国钢材进口量仅占总供给的 1%。产能产量双控仍然是政策管控的重点，国内粗钢产量持续下降趋势延续，但产能利用率进一步提升。","link":"/lucfe-hexo/0005%20Applied%20science/%E5%B7%A5%E7%A8%8B%E4%B8%8E%E6%8A%80%E6%9C%AF%E7%A7%91%E5%AD%A6%20Engineering%20and%20technology/%E6%9D%90%E6%96%99%E7%A7%91%E5%AD%A6%20Materials%20science%20and%20engineering/%E7%82%BC%E9%92%A2wiki/"},{"title":"diy

2021 年末，国家能源集团、国家电投、华能集团、大唐集团这四大国有发电企业的风电机组装机容量为 14284 万千瓦，约占全国风电机组装机容量的 43%，大型国有发电企业占据主要市场份额，市场集中度高。2019-2021 年末火电、水电、风电、太阳能发电、核电机组装机容量的年均复合增速分别为 4.41%、4.49%、25.32%、22.38%、4.53%，风电、太阳能发电的装机容量增速相对较快。 7轴承是用途较为广泛的机械设备零部件，主要作用是支撑旋转轴或其它运动体，引导转动或移动运动并承受由轴或轴上零件传递而来的载荷。轴承根据工作时运转的轴与轴承座之间的摩擦性质，可分为滑动轴承和滚动轴承两类，其中滚动轴承是轴承工业的主要产品，通常所说的轴承，一般指滚动轴承。只要涉及旋转轴的机械结构就需要轴承来起到支撑和减小摩擦的作用轴承的主机配套类型较多，风电轴承是其中一类，在下游应用领域中，汽车领域应用占比为 40%，电工轴承占比 15%，机床轴承占比10%，工程机械轴承占比 7%，风电轴承是第五大类别，约占轴承总需求量的 6%。轴承产业链的上游原材料主要是轴承钢以及少部分的非金属材料零部件主要包括内圈外圈、滚动体、保持器和密封圈。瑞典斯凯孚、德国舍弗勒、日本恩斯克等八家轴承企业在国际轴承市场的市场占有率合计达到 70%以上，而国内企业主要占据中低端市场。风电工况恶劣，对轴承的可靠性要求较高，因此风电轴承相较其他应用领域具有更高的技术复杂度，是风电领域国产化难度较高的两大部件之一，另一个是控制系统。双馈式风机为例，风电轴承主要分变桨、偏航轴承和传动系统轴承（主轴、齿轮箱及电机轴承）两大类，每台风力发电机内各类轴承配套数量为主轴轴承 1-2 个（小兆瓦用 1 个，大兆瓦用 2 个）、偏航轴承 1 个、变桨轴承 3 个、发电机轴承 1 套和齿轮箱轴承 1 套。主轴和齿轮箱轴承用到球面滚子轴承、单排/双排大直径圆锥滚子轴承和圆筒形滚柱轴承等，应用于偏航、变桨的旋转枢轴轴承等。 偏航轴承:连接机舱和塔筒，跟踪风向的变化，确保最大的发电量变桨轴承:位于叶片与轮毂之间，调整桨叶迎风角度，使其达到最佳状态风电轴承的关键技术主要体现在设计、材料、防腐和密封等方面，主轴轴承和齿轮箱轴 承还需进行高精度加工，偏航、变桨轴承则需要解决好游隙设计和磨削加工滚道技术等。轴承设计对设备运行的寿命和稳定性有重要影响 前国内部分厂家能够生产风电轴承，但主要集中在 2MW 及以下风电轴承，对于 3MW 及以上风电轴承，由于技术难度高，国内生产还处于起步阶段，进口依赖度较高，中大型轴承本土产量占比不足 13%。齿轮箱轴承目前的国产化程度较低,由于齿轮箱的工况更加恶劣，鉴于高昂的维保成本，对齿轮箱轴承的稳定性和可靠性要求更高统一变桨控制的机组在运行过程中面临湍流、风切变等外部气动条件时，每个叶片接受一个大小相同的变桨命令来调节桨距角，以确保机组保持额定状态，无法实现风轮载荷平衡，并会因此引起传动链的震动，最终会增加机组疲劳载荷，从而导致机组制造成本的增加、安全稳定性的下降和使用寿命的缩短。为解决机组载荷不平衡的问题，独立变桨技术的研究应运而生.以单个叶片上的受力状况或风速条件为输入，单独为每个叶片给定各自的桨距角附加值，从而使各个叶片的受力状况趋于一致，从而减小由湍流、风切变等外部因素引起的风轮面内载荷不平衡以及机组振动，从而降低整机疲劳载荷，降低机组制造成本，提高机组运行的安全可靠性。独立变桨系统包括液压变桨距系统和电动变桨距系统两种。大型风力发电机组发展的趋势是采用电动变桨距系统。独立变桨轴承的结构也将从单排、双排、球轴承向承载力更强的三排圆柱滚子轴承转变，单套价值量有所提升，驱动变桨轴承市场扩容。 国内风电机组中，水平轴风电机组是主要机型，水平轴主要包括双馈型机组（带增速齿轮箱）、直驱型机组（不带增速齿轮箱）和半直驱型机组（带中速齿轮箱的直驱系统）,其中又以双馈型机组为主，双馈和直驱型机组全面对比：各具优劣势，中长期半直驱/直驱型占比提升双馈式风电机组一般采用的是转子交流励磁双馈发电机，其结构与绕线式异步电机类似永磁直驱风电机组取消了增速齿轮箱，风轮轴直接和发电机轴直接相连，发电机多采用永磁式结构的转子的同步发电机，无须外部提供励磁电源。转子的转速随风速的变化而改变，其交流电的频率也随之变化，经过全功率电力电子变频器将频率不定的交流电整流成直流电，再逆变成与电网同频率的交流电输出同功率的直驱机组和双馈机组由效率不同带来的成本差异是不明显的。对比度电成本来看，度电成本最低的是永磁半直驱机组，其次是双馈机组，度电成本最高的是永磁直驱机组。从可靠性方面来看，直驱机组的可靠性最高长期来看，风机往更高功率方向演进，半直驱和直驱具有天然的可靠性优势，两者的装机占比有望进一步提升。 调心性能，可以自动调整因轴与轴承座之间的角度误差所产生的倾斜或轴的挠曲。调心滚子轴承可以承受较大的径向载荷与双向轴向载荷。 单列圆锥滚子轴承可以承受一个方向的轴向载荷。并能限制轴相对轴承座一个方向的轴向位移。 “双列圆锥滚子轴承在承受以径向负荷同时，可承受双向轴向负荷，可在轴承的轴向游隙范围内，限制轴承或外壳的双向轴向位移。” 变桨控制意味着叶片可以在 0°到 90°之间转动。在风速低于额定速度（通常为 12m/s）时，风轮叶片会转动到完全朝向风向，即桨距为 0°。当风速增大时，可以控制叶片桨距，将风机的输出功率调整到其额定值。当风速达到预定极限时（通常为 28m/s），风机将叶片转动到 90°，停止发电。 滚动体行业具有较高的技术壁垒。","link":"/lucfe-hexo/0005%20Applied%20science/%E5%B7%A5%E7%A8%8B%E4%B8%8E%E6%8A%80%E6%9C%AF%E7%A7%91%E5%AD%A6%20Engineering%20and%20technology/%E6%9C%BA%E6%A2%B0%E5%B7%A5%E7%A8%8B%20Mechanical%20engineering/%E9%A3%8E%E6%9C%BAwiki/"},{"title":"","text":"液压wiki液压控制阀是指液压传动系统或液压控制系统中用来控制液体压力、流量和方向的元件。其中控制压力的称为压力控制阀，控制流量的称为流量控制阀，控制通、断和流向的称为方向控制阀。

metal–oxide–semiconductor field-effect transistor (MOSFET) fabrication process that uses complementary and symmetrical pairs of p-type and n-type MOSFETs for logic functions.[1] CMOS technology is used for constructing integrated circuit (IC) chipsThe metal–oxide–semiconductor field-effect transistor (MOSFET, MOS-FET, or MOS FET) is a type of field-effect transistor (FET), most commonly fabricated by the controlled oxidation of silicon. It has an insulated gate, the voltage of which determines the conductivity of the device. This ability to change conductivity with the amount of applied voltage can be used for amplifying or switching electronic signals. A metal-insulator-semiconductor field-effect transistor (MISFET) is a term almost synonymous with MOSFET. Another synonym is IGFET for insulated-gate field-effect transistor.A bipolar junction transistor (BJT) is a type of transistor that uses both electrons and electron holes as charge carriers. In contrast, a unipolar transistor, such as a field-effect transistor, uses only one kind of charge carrier. A bipolar transistor allows a small current injected at one of its terminals to control a much larger current flowing between the terminals, making the device capable of amplification or switching.A transistor is a semiconductor device used to amplify or switch electrical signals and power. The transistor is one of the basic building blocks of modern electronics.[1] It is composed of semiconductor material, usually with at least three terminals for connection to an electronic circuit. A voltage or current applied to one pair of the transistor’s terminals controls the current through another pair of terminals. Because the controlled (output) power can be higher than the controlling (input) power, a transistor can amplify a signal.

Inverters do the opposite of rectifiers“整流器A rectifier is an electrical device that converts alternating current (AC), which periodically reverses direction, to direct current (DC), which flows in only one direction. The reverse operation is performed by the inverter. The process is known as rectification, since it “”straightens”” the direction of current.”“Uninterruptible power suppliesAn uninterruptible power supply (UPS) uses batteries and an inverter to supply AC power when mains power is not available. When mains power is restored, a rectifier supplies DC power to recharge the batteries.”“Electric motor speed controlInverter circuits designed to produce a variable output voltage range are often used within motor speed controllers. ““In refrigeration compressorsAn inverter can be used to control the speed of the compressor motor to drive variable refrigerant flow in a refrigeration or air conditioning system to regulate system performance.”inverter-equipped systems have a variable-frequency drive that control the speed of the motor and thus the compressor and cooling output. The variable-frequency AC from the inverter drives a brushless or induction motor, the speed of which is proportional to the frequency of the AC it is fed, so the compressor can be run at variable speeds—eliminating compressor stop-start cycles increases efficiencyA variable-frequency drive (VFD) is a type of motor drive used in electro-mechanical drive systems to control AC motor speed and torque by varying motor input frequency and, depending on topology, to control associated voltage or current variation. VFDs may also be known as ‘AFDs’ (adjustable-frequency drives), ‘ASDs’ (adjustable-speed drives), ‘VSDs’ (variable-speed drives), ‘AC drives’, ‘micro drives’, ‘inverter drives’ or, simply, ‘drives’.Systems using VFDs can be more efficient than those using throttling control of fluid flow, such as in systems with pumps and damper control for fans.

同步电动机是一种交流电动机，转子旋转速度与所提供交流电的频率相同。原理是由交流电在电动机的定子处产生旋转磁场，使电动机转子旋转。同步电动机的特点是转速固定，不受电源电压的影响。只要电动机的负载低于其最大转矩，转速也不会受负载的影响。由于这种特性，同步电动机只能使用变频器由调整电动机的电源频率来进行调速。“同步电机和异步电机最大的区别在于它们的转子速度与定子旋转磁场是否一致，电机的转子速度与定子旋转磁场相同，叫同步电机，反之，则叫异步电机。另外，同步电机与异步电机的定子绕组是相同的，区别在于电机的转子结构。异步电机的转子是短路的绕组，靠电磁感应产生电流。”DC-excited

是由于转子旋转是来自于感应磁场的变化，因此异步电机也称作感应电机。转子与同步电机不同，是闭合线圈，工作原理就是磁场的旋转使得闭合线圈切割磁感线产生电流，进而受到磁场力发生旋转。为了保证转速的稳定，一般闭合线圈采用鼠笼式结构。 “新能源车驱动电机是电动车的核心部件之一，主要以永磁同步电机为主，占比超 80%，其他包括交流异步电机和开关磁阻电机等”

switch顾名思义主要是用来把下游的设备从系统中隔离出去，实际操作中不可以在有电流的情况下开关。隔离开关是一种主要用于“隔离电源、倒闸操作、用以连通和切断小电流电路”，无灭弧功能的开关器件。热保护也就是过载保护。热保护：电流经过脱扣器时热元件发热（直热式电流直接过双金属片），双金属片受热变形，当变形至一定程度时，打击牵引杆从而带动机构动作切断电路。电磁脱扣器提供短路保护:电磁脱扣器与被保护电路串联。线路中通过正常电流时，电磁铁产生的电磁力小于反作用力弹簧的拉力，衔铁不能被电磁铁吸动，断路器正常运行。当线路中出现短路故障时，电流超过正常电流的若干倍，电磁铁产生的电磁力大于反作用力弹簧的作用力，衔铁被电磁铁吸动通过传动机构推动自由脱扣机构释放主触头。失压脱扣器并联在断路器的电源侧，可起到欠压及零压保护的作用。当电源侧停电或电源电压过低时，电磁铁所产生的电磁力不足以克服反作用力弹簧的拉力，衔铁被向上拉，通过传动机构推动自由脱扣机构使断路器掉闸，起到欠压及零压保护作用。分励脱扣器常用在远距离自动断电的控制上，用得最多的就是消防控制室切断非消防电源,分励脱扣器本质上是一个分闸线圈加脱扣器，给分励脱扣线圈加上规定的电压，断路器就脱扣而分闸。

describing the structure of documents displayed on the web. HTML documents are basically a tree of nodes, including HTML elements and text nodes. HTML elements provide the semantics and formatting for documents, including creating paragraphs, lists and tables, and embedding images and form controls. ElementsHTML consists of a series of elements, which you use to enclose, or wrap, different parts of the content to make it appear or act in a certain way. example: Elements and tags aren’t the exact same thing, though many people use the terms interchangeably.The tag name is the content in the brackets. The tag includes the brackets. In this case, &lt;h1&gt;. An “element” is the opening and closing tags, and all the content between those tags, including nested elements. When nesting elements, it’s important that they are properly nested. HTML tags should be closed in the reverse order of which they were opened. In the above example, notice how the &lt;em&gt; is both opened and closed within the opening and closing &lt;strong&gt; tags, and the &lt;strong&gt; is both open and closed within the &lt;p&gt; tags. 123&lt;p&gt;This paragraph has some &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;strongly emphasized&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; content&lt;/p&gt; while it is valid to omit tags, don’t. Non-replaced elementsNon-replaced elements have opening and (sometimes optional) closing tags that surround them and may include text and other tags as sub-elements. Replaced and void elementsReplaced elements are replaced by objects, be it a graphical user interface (UI) widget in the case of most form controls, or a raster or scalable image file in the case of most images. example: the two replaced elements &lt;img&gt; and &lt;input&gt; are replaced by non-text content: an image and a graphical user interface object, respectively. 12&lt;input type=&quot;range&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;switch.svg&quot; alt=&quot;light switch&quot;&gt; Void elements are all self-closing elements and are represented by one tag. This means there is no such thing as a closing tag for a void element. Optionally, you can include a slash at the end of the tag, which many people find makes markup easier to read. example, we self close the tag with a slash: 12&lt;input type=&quot;range&quot;/&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;switch.svg&quot; alt=&quot;light switch&quot;/&gt; Replaced elements and void elements are often confused. Most replaced elements are void elements, but not all. The video, picture, object, and iframe elements are replaced, but aren’t void. They can all contain other elements or text, so they all have a closing tag. Most void elements are replaced; but again, not all, as we saw with base, link, param, and meta. AttributesThese extra bits of space-separated name/value pairs (though sometimes including a value is optional) are called attributes. Attributes provide information about the element. The attribute, like the rest of the opening tag, won’t appear in the content, but they do help define how the content will appear to both your sighted and non-sighted (assistive technologies and search engines) users. The opening tag always starts with the element type. The type can be followed by zero or more attributes, separated by one or more spaces. Most attribute names are followed by an equal sign equating it with the attribute value, wrapped with opening and closing quotation marks. some attributes are global—meaning they can appear within any element’s opening tag. Some apply only to several elements but not all, and others are element-specific, relevant only to a single element. Most attributes are name/value pairs. Boolean attributes, whose value is true, false, or the same as the name of the attribute, can be included as just the attribute: the value is not necessary. &lt;img src=&quot;switch.svg&quot; alt=&quot;light switch&quot; ismap /&gt; If the value includes a space or special characters, quotes are needed. For this reason, quoting is always recommended.for legibility, quotes and spaces are recommended, and appreciated. Values that are defined in the specification are case-insensitive. Strings that are not defined as keywords are generally case-sensitive, including id and class values. Note that if an attribute value is case-sensitive in HTML, it is case-sensitive when used as part of an attribute selector in CSS and in JavaScript. it is recommended, but not required, to mark up your HTML using lowercase letters for all your element names and attribute names within your tags, and quote all attribute values. Appearance of elementsHTML should be used to structure content, not to define the content’s appearance. Appearance is the realm of CSS. While many elements that alter the appearance of content, such as &lt;h1&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;, have a semantic meaning, the appearance can and generally will be changed with author styles. 1&lt;h1&gt;This header has both &lt;strong&gt;strong&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;em&gt;emphasized&lt;/em&gt; content&lt;/h1&gt; Element, attributes, and JavaScriptThe Document Object Model (DOM) is the data representation of the structure and content of the HTML document. As the browser parses HTML, it creates a JavaScript object for every element and section of text encountered. These objects are called nodes—element nodes and text nodes, respectively. HTML DOM API HTMLElement HTMLAnchorElementHTMLImageElement Document structure1234567891011121314151617&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;&lt;html lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt; &lt;head&gt; &lt;meta charset=&quot;utf-8&quot; /&gt; &lt;title&gt;Machine Learning Workshop&lt;/title&gt; &lt;meta name=&quot;viewport&quot; content=&quot;width=device-width&quot; /&gt; &lt;link rel=&quot;stylesheet&quot; src=&quot;css/styles.css&quot; /&gt; &lt;link rel=&quot;icon&quot; type=&quot;image/png&quot; href=&quot;/images/favicon.png&quot; /&gt; &lt;link rel=&quot;alternate&quot; href=&quot;https://www.machinelearningworkshop.com/fr/&quot; hreflang=&quot;fr-FR&quot; /&gt; &lt;link rel=&quot;alternate&quot; href=&quot;https://www.machinelearningworkshop.com/pt/&quot; hreflang=&quot;pt-BR&quot; /&gt; &lt;link rel=&quot;canonical&quot; href=&quot;https://www.machinelearning.com&quot; /&gt; &lt;/head&gt; &lt;body&gt; &lt;!-- &lt;script defer src=&quot;scripts/lightswitch.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;--&gt; &lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt; HTML documents include a document type declaration and the &lt;html&gt; root element. Nested in the &lt;html&gt; element are the document head and document body. While the head of the document isn’t visible to the sighted visitor, it is vital to make your site function. It contains all the meta information, including information for search engines and social media results, icons for the browser tab and mobile home screen shortcut, and the behavior and presentation of your content. Add to every HTML document&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;The first thing in any HTML document is the preamble. For HTML, all you need is &lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;. This may look like an HTML element, but it isn’t. It’s a special kind of node called “doctype”. The doctype tells the browser to use standards mode. If omitted, browsers will use a different rendering mode known as quirks mode. &lt;html&gt;The &lt;html&gt; element is the root element for an HTML document. It is the parent of the &lt;head&gt; and &lt;body&gt;, containing everything in the HTML document other than the doctype. If omitted it will be implied, but it is important to include it, as this is the element on which the language of the content of the document is declared. Content languageThe lang language attribute added to the &lt;html&gt; tag defines the main language of the document. The value of the lang attribute is a two- or three-letter ISO language code followed by the region. The region is optional, but recommended, as a language can vary greatly between regions. The lang attribute is not limited to the &lt;html&gt; tag. If there is text within the page that is in a language different from the main document language, the lang attribute should be used to identify exceptions to the main language within the document. Required components inside the &lt;head&gt;1234567891011&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;&lt;html lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt; &lt;head&gt; &lt;meta charset=&quot;utf-8&quot; /&gt; &lt;title&gt;Machine Learning Workshop&lt;/title&gt; &lt;meta name=&quot;viewport&quot; content=&quot;width=device-width&quot; /&gt; &lt;/head&gt; &lt;body&gt; &lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt; Character encodingThe very first element in the &lt;head&gt; should be the charset character encoding declaration. It comes before the title to ensure the browser can render the characters in that title and all the characters in the rest of the document. The default encoding in most browsers is windows-1252, depending on the locale. However, you should use UTF-8, as it enables the one- to four-byte encoding of all characters, even ones you didn’t even know existed. Also, it’s the encoding type required by HTML5. To set the character encoding to UTF-8, include: &lt;meta charset=&quot;utf-8&quot; /&gt; The character encoding is inherited into everything in the document, even &lt;style&gt; and &lt;script&gt;. Document titleYour home page and all additional pages should each have a unique title. The contents for the document title, the text between the opening and closing &lt;title&gt; tags, are displayed in the browser tab, the list of open windows, the history, search results, and, unless redefined with &lt;meta&gt; tags, in social media cards. &lt;title&gt;Machine Learning Workshop&lt;/title&gt; Viewport metadataThe other meta tag that should be considered essential is the viewport meta tag, which helps site responsiveness, enabling content to render well by default, no matter the viewport width. it enables controlling a viewport’s size and scale, and prevents the site’s content from being sized down to fit a 960px site onto a 320px screen, it is definitely recommended. &lt;meta name=&quot;viewport&quot; content=&quot;width=device-width&quot; /&gt;The preceding code means “make the site responsive, starting by making the width of the content the width of the screen”. In addition to width, you can set zoom and scalability, but they both default to accessible values. If you want to be explicit, include:&lt;meta name=&quot;viewport&quot; content=&quot;width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=1&quot; /&gt; Other &lt;head&gt; contentCSSThere are three ways to include CSS: &lt;link&gt;, &lt;style&gt;, and the style attribute. Styles, either via &lt;link&gt; or &lt;style&gt;, or both, should go in the head. They will work if included in the document’s body, but you want your styles in the head for performance reasons. That may seem counterintuitive, as you may think you want your content to load first, but you actually want the browser to know how to render the content when it is loaded. Adding styles first prevents the unnecessary repainting that occurs if an element is styled after it is first rendered. including an external resource using a &lt;link&gt; element with the rel attribute set to stylesheet The &lt;link&gt; tag is the preferred method of including stylesheets. Linking a single or a few external style sheets is good for both developer experience and site performance: you get to maintain CSS in one spot instead of it being sprinkled everywhere, and browsers can cache the external file, meaning it doesn’t have to be downloaded again with every page navigation. The syntax is &lt;link rel=&quot;stylesheet&quot; href=&quot;styles.css&quot;&gt;, where styles.css is the URL of your stylesheet. You’ll often see type=”text/css”. Not necessary! If you are including styles written in something other than CSS, the type is needed, but since there isn’t any other type, this attribute isn’t needed. The rel attribute defines the relationship: in this case stylesheet. If you omit this, your CSS will not be linked. including CSS directly in the head of your document within opening and closing &lt;style&gt; tags. custom properties declared in a head style block: 12345&lt;style&gt; :root { --theme-color: #226DAA; }&lt;/style&gt; If you want your external style sheet styles to be within a cascade layer but you don’t have access to edit the CSS file to put the layer information in it, you’ll want to include the CSS with @import inside a &lt;style&gt;: 123&lt;style&gt; @import &quot;styles.css&quot; layer(firstLayer);&lt;/style&gt; When using @import to import style sheets into your document, optionally into cascade layers, the @import statements must be the first statements in your &lt;style&gt; Other uses of the &lt;link&gt; elementThe link element is used to create relationships between the HTML document and external resources. Some of these resources may be downloaded, others are informational. It’s preferable to include those related to meta information in the head and those related to performance in the &lt;body&gt;. You’ll include three other types in your header now: icon, alternate, and canonical FaviconUse the &lt;link&gt; tag, with the rel=&quot;icon&quot; attribute/value pair to identify the favicon to be used for your document. A favicon is a very small icon that appears on the browser tab, generally to the left of the document title. When you have an unwieldy number of tabs open, the tabs will shrink and the title may disappear altogether, but the icon always remains visible. Most favicons are company or application logos. If you don’t declare a favicon, the browser will look for a file named favicon.ico in the top-level directory (the website’s root folder). With &lt;link&gt;, you can use a different file name and location: &lt;link rel=&quot;icon&quot; sizes=&quot;16x16 32x32 48x48&quot; type=&quot;image/png&quot; href=&quot;/images/mlwicon.png&quot; /&gt; The sizes attribute accepts the value of any for scalable icons or a space-separated list of square widthXheight values; where the width and height values are 16, 32, 48, or greater in that geometric sequence, the pixel unit is omitted, and the X is case-insensitive. While you can use &lt;link&gt; to define a completely different image on each page or even each page load, don’t. For consistency and a good user experience, use a single image! Alternate versions of the siteWe use the alternate value of the rel attribute to identify translations, or alternate representations, of the site. Let’s pretend we have versions of the site translated into French and Brazilian Portuguese:When using alternate for a translation, the hreflang attribute must be set. 12&lt;link rel=&quot;alternate&quot; href=&quot;https://www.machinelearningworkshop.com/fr/&quot; hreflang=&quot;fr-FR&quot; /&gt;&lt;link rel=&quot;alternate&quot; href=&quot;https://www.machinelearningworkshop.com/pt/&quot; hreflang=&quot;pt-BR&quot; /&gt; The alternate value is for more than just translations. For example, the type attribute can define the alternate URI for an RSS feed when the type attribute is set to application/rss+xml or application/atom+xml. example, link to a pretend PDF version of the site. &lt;link rel=&quot;alternate&quot; type=&quot;application/x-pdf&quot; href=&quot;https://machinelearningworkshop.com/mlw.pdf&quot; /&gt; CanonicalIf you create several translations or versions of Machine Learning Workshop, search engines may get confused as to which version is the authoritative source. For this, use rel=”canonical” to identify the preferred URL for the site or application. Include the canonical URL on all of your translated pages, and on the home page, indicating our preferred URL: &lt;link rel=&quot;canonical&quot; href=&quot;https://www.machinelearning.com&quot; /&gt; most often used for cross-posting with publications and blogging platforms to credit the original source; when a site syndicates content, it should include the canonical link to the original source. ScriptsThe &lt;script&gt; tag is used to include, well, scripts. The default type is JavaScript. If you include any other scripting language, include the type attribute with the mime type, or type=”module” if it’s a JavaScript module. Only JavaScript and JavaScript modules get parsed and executed. JavaScript is not only render-blocking, but the browser stops downloading all assets when scripts are downloaded and doesn’t resume downloading other assets until the JavaScript is executed. reduce the blocking nature of JavaScript download and execution: defer and async. With defer, HTML rendering is not blocked during the download, and the JavaScript only executes after the document has otherwise finished rendering. With async, rendering isn’t blocked during the download either, but once the script has finished downloading, the rendering is paused while the JavaScript is executed. example: &lt;script src=&quot;js/switch.js&quot; defer&gt;&lt;/script&gt; Adding the defer attribute defers the execution of the script until after everything is rendered, preventing the script from harming performance. The async and defer attributes are only valid on external scripts. BaseThere is another element that is only found in the &lt;head&gt;. Not used very often, the &lt;base&gt; element allows setting a default link URL and target. The href attribute defines the base URL for all relative links. The target attribute, valid on &lt;base&gt; as well as on links and forms, sets where those links should open.The default of _self opens linked files in the same context as the current document.Other options include _blank, which opens every link in a new window,the _parent of the current content, which may be the same as self if the opener is not an iframe,or _top, which is in the same browser tab, but popped out of any context to take up the entire tab. example:If our website found itself nested within an iframe on a site like Yummly, including the &lt;base&gt; element would mean when a user clicks on any links within our document, the link will load popped out of the iframe, taking up the whole browser window. &lt;base target=&quot;_top&quot; href=&quot;https://machinelearningworkshop.com&quot; /&gt; anchor links are resolved with &lt;base&gt;. The &lt;base&gt; effectively converts the link &lt;a href=&quot;#ref&quot;&gt; to &lt;a target=&quot;_top&quot; href=&quot;https://machinelearningworkshop.com#ref&quot;&gt;, triggering an HTTP request to the base URL with the fragment attached. there can be only one &lt;base&gt; element in a document, and it should come before any relative URLs are used, including possible script or stylesheet references. HTML commentsAnything between &lt;!-- and --&gt; will not be visible or parsed. HTML comments can be put anywhere on the page, including the head or body, with the exception of scripts or style blocks, where you should use JavaScript and CSS comments, respectively. MetadataOfficially defined meta tagsThere are two main types of meta tags: pragma directives, with the http-equiv attribute like the charset meta tag used to have, and named meta types, like the viewport meta tag with the name attribute that we discussed in the document structure section. Both the name and http-equiv meta types must include the content attribute, which defines the content for the type of metadata listed. Pragma directivesThe http-equiv attribute has as its value a pragma directive. These directives describe how the page should be parsed. Supported http-equiv values enable setting directives when you are unable to set HTTP headers directly. most of which have other methods of being set. For example, while you can include a language directive with &lt;meta http-equiv=&quot;content-language&quot; content=&quot;en-us&quot; /&gt;,&lt;meta charset=&lt;charset&gt;&quot; /&gt; example 1 :The most common pragma directive is the refresh directive.While you can set a directive to refresh at an interval of the number of seconds set in the content attribute, and even redirect to a different URL, please don’t. &lt;meta http-equiv=&quot;refresh&quot; content=&quot;60; https://machinelearningworkshop.com/regTimeout&quot; /&gt; example 2 :The most useful pragma directive is content-security-policy, which enables defining a content policy for the current document. Content policies mostly specify allowed server origins and script endpoints, which help guard against cross-site scripting attacks. &lt;meta http-equiv=&quot;content-security-policy&quot; content=&quot;default-src https:&quot; /&gt; Named meta tagsThe name attribute is the name of the metadata. In addition to viewport, you will probably want to include description and theme-color, but not keywords. KeywordsSearch engine optimization snake-oil salespeople abused the keywords meta tag by stuffing them with comma-separated lists of spam words instead of lists of relevant key terms, so search engines do not consider this metadata to be useful anymore. No need to waste time, effort, or bytes adding it. DescriptionThe description value, however, is super important for SEO; in addition to helping sites rank based on the content, the description content value is often what search engines display under the page’s title in search results. Several browsers, like Firefox and Opera, use this as the default description of bookmarked pages. The description should be a short and accurate summary of the page’s content. &lt;meta name=&quot;description&quot; content=&quot;Register for a machine learning workshop at our school for machines who can't learn good and want to do other stuff good too&quot; /&gt; RobotsIf you don’t want your site to be indexed by search engines, you can let them know. &lt;meta name=&quot;robots&quot; content=&quot;noindex, nofollow&quot; /&gt; tells the bots to not index the site and not to follow any links. You don’t need to include &lt;meta name=&quot;robots&quot; content=&quot;index, follow&quot; /&gt; to request indexing the site and following links, as that is the default, unless HTTP headers say otherwise. &lt;meta name=&quot;robots&quot; content=&quot;index, follow&quot; /&gt; Theme colorThe theme-color value lets you define a color to customize the browser interface. The color value on the content attribute will be used by supporting browsers and operating systems, letting you provide a suggested color for the user agents that support coloring the title bar, tab bar, or other chrome components. The theme color meta tag can include a media attribute enabling the setting of different theme colors based on media queries. The media attribute can be included in this meta tag only and is ignored in all other meta tags. &lt;meta name=&quot;theme-color&quot; content=&quot;#226DAA&quot; /&gt; Open GraphOpen Graph and similar meta tag protocols can be used to control how social media sites, like Twitter, LinkedIn, and Facebook, display links to your content. If not included, social media sites will correctly grab the title of your page and the description from the description meta tag, the same information as search engines will present When you post a link to MachineLearningWorkshop.com or web.dev on Facebook or Twitter, a card with an image, site title, and site description appears. The entire card is a hyperlink to the URL you provided. Open Graph meta tags have two attributes each: the property attribute instead of the name attribute, and the content or value for that property.

Accessibility object model (AOM)As the browser parses the content received, it builds the document object model (DOM) and the CSS object model (CSSOM). It then also builds an accessibility tree. Assistive devices, such as screen readers, use the AOM to parse and interpret content. The DOM is a tree of all the nodes in the document. The AOM is like a semantic version of the DOM. The role attributeThe role attribute describes the role an element has in the context of the document. The role attribute is a global attribute—meaning it is valid on all elements—defined by the ARIA specification rather than the WHATWG HTML specification, where almost everything else in this series is defined. Semantic elementsAsking yourself, “Which element best represents the function of this section of markup?” will generally result in you picking the best element for the job. The element you choose, and therefore the tags you use, should be appropriate for the content you are displaying, as tags have semantic meaning.

The &lt;header&gt; element isn’t always a landmark. It has different semantics depending on where it is nested. When the &lt;header&gt; is top level, it is the site banner, a landmark role, which you may have noted in the role code block. When a &lt;header&gt; is nested in &lt;main&gt;, &lt;article&gt;, or &lt;section&gt;, it just identifies it as the header for that section and isn’t a landmark. The &lt;nav&gt; element identifies content as navigation. As this &lt;nav&gt; is nested in the site heading, it is the main navigation for the site. If it was nested in an &lt;article&gt; or &lt;section&gt;, it would be internal navigation for that section only. Using &lt;/nav&gt; and &lt;/header&gt; closing tags removes the need for comments to identify which element each end tag closed. In addition, using different tags for different elements removes the need for id and class hooks. The CSS selectors can have low specificity; you can probably target the links with header nav a without worrying about conflict. Site &lt;footer&gt;123&lt;footer&gt; &lt;p&gt;&amp;copy;2022 Machine Learning Workshop, LLC. All rights reserved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/footer&gt; Similar to &lt;header&gt;, whether the footer is a landmark depends on where the footer is nested. When it is the site footer, it is a landmark, and should contain the site footer information you want on every page, such as a copyright statement, contact information, and links to your privacy and cookie policies. The implicit role for the site footer is contentinfo. Otherwise, the footer has no implicit role and is not a landmark, When a &lt;footer&gt; is a descendant of an &lt;article&gt;, &lt;aside&gt;, &lt;main&gt;, &lt;nav&gt;, or &lt;section&gt;, it’s not a landmark. Document structureA layout with a header, two sidebars, and a footer, is known as the holy grail layout. 1234567&lt;body&gt; &lt;header&gt;Header&lt;/header&gt; &lt;nav&gt;Nav&lt;/nav&gt; &lt;main&gt;Content&lt;/main&gt; &lt;aside&gt;Aside&lt;/aside&gt; &lt;footer&gt;Footer&lt;/footer&gt;&lt;/body&gt; a blog, you might have a series of articles in : 12345678910&lt;body&gt; &lt;header&gt;Header&lt;/header&gt; &lt;nav&gt;Nav&lt;/nav&gt; &lt;main&gt; &lt;article&gt;First post&lt;/article&gt; &lt;article&gt;Second post&lt;/article&gt; &lt;/main&gt; &lt;aside&gt;Aside&lt;/aside&gt; &lt;footer&gt;Footer&lt;/footer&gt;&lt;/body&gt; &lt;main&gt;There’s a single &lt;main&gt; landmark element. The &lt;main&gt; element identifies the main content of the document. There should be only one &lt;main&gt; per page. &lt;aside&gt;The &lt;aside&gt; is for content that is indirectly or tangentially related to the document’s main content.like most, the &lt;aside&gt; would likely be presented in a sidebar or a call-out box. The &lt;aside&gt; is also a landmark, with the implicit role of complementary. &lt;article&gt;An &lt;article&gt; represents a complete, or self-contained, section of content that is, in principle, independently reusable. Think of an article as you would an article in a newspaper. &lt;section&gt;The &lt;section&gt; element is used to encompass generic standalone sections of a document when there is no more specific semantic element to use. Sections should have a heading, with very few exceptions. A &lt;section&gt; isn’t a landmark unless it has an accessible name; if it has an accessible name, the implicit role is region. Landmark roles should be used sparingly, to identify larger overall sections of the document. Using too many landmark roles can create “noise” in screen readers, making it difficult to understand the overall layout of the page. Headings: &lt;h1&gt;-&lt;h6&gt;When a heading is nested in a document banner &lt;header&gt;, it is the heading for the application or site. When nested in &lt;main&gt;, whether or not it is nested within a &lt;header&gt; in &lt;main&gt;, it is the header for that page, not the whole site. When nested in an &lt;article&gt; or &lt;section&gt;, it is the header for that subsection of the page. It is recommended to use heading levels similarly to heading levels in a text editor: starting with a &lt;h1&gt; as the main heading, with &lt;h2&gt; as headings for sub-sections, and &lt;h3&gt; if those sub-sections have sections; avoid skipping heading levels.","link":"/lucfe-hexo/0004%20Formal%20science/%E8%AE%A1%E7%AE%97%E6%9C%BA%E7%A7%91%E5%AD%A6%E6%8A%80%E6%9C%AF%20Computer%20science/Software%20notations%C2%A0and%C2%A0tools/html%20css%20js/html/"},{"title":"javascript problems 1","text":"(0,function)(arg1,agr2,)123(0, function (arg) { console.log(arg) })(2);console.log((0, 1, 2, 3));(0, function plus1 (arg) { console.log(arg + 1) }, function plus2 (arg) { console.log(arg + 2) })(5); example one12345678(function() { (0,eval)(&quot;var foo = 123&quot;); // indirect call to eval, creates global variable})();console.log(foo); // 123(function() { eval(&quot;var bar = 123&quot;); // direct call to eval, creates local variable})();console.log(bar); // ReferenceError example twowhen you want to call a method without passing the object as the this value: 12345var obj = { method: function() { return this; }};console.log(obj.method() === obj); // trueconsole.log((0,obj.method)() === obj); // false example threedepending on the context, it might be the arguments separator instead of a comma operator: 123456console.log( function(a, b) { return function() { return a; }; } (0, function (arg) { /* ... */ })(this)); // 0 In this scenario, (0, function (arg) { /* ... */ }) are the arguments (a=0, b=function (arg) { /* ... */ }) to the function 123function(a, b) { return function() { return a; };} rather than the comma operator.

It is called JSX, and it is a syntax extension to JavaScript. We recommend using it with React to describe what the UI should look like. JSX may remind you of a template language, but it comes with the full power of JavaScript. JSX produces React “elements”. Instead of artificially separating technologies by putting markup and logic in separate files, React separates concerns with loosely coupled units called “components” that contain both. - Embedding Expressions in JSX In the example below, we declare a variable called name and then use it inside JSX by wrapping it in curly braces: const name = 'Josh Perez'; const element = Hello, {name}; - JSX is an Expression Too After compilation, JSX expressions become regular JavaScript function calls and evaluate to JavaScript objects. This means that you can use JSX inside of if statements and for loops, assign it to variables, accept it as arguments, and return it from functions: 123456function getGreeting(user) { if (user) { return &lt;h1&gt;Hello, {formatName(user)}!&lt;/h1&gt;; } return &lt;h1&gt;Hello, Stranger.&lt;/h1&gt;;} - Specifying Attributes with JSX You may use quotes to specify string literals as attributes: `const element = link ;` You may also use curly braces to embed a JavaScript expression in an attribute: `const element = ;` - Specifying Children with JSX If a tag is empty, you may close it immediately with />, like XML: `const element = ;` JSX tags may contain children: 123456const element = ( &lt;div&gt; &lt;h1&gt;Hello!&lt;/h1&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Good to see you here.&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;/div&gt;); - JSX Prevents Injection Attacks It is safe to embed user input in JSX: const title = response.potentiallyMaliciousInput; // This is safe: const element = {title}; By default, React DOM escapes any values embedded in JSX before rendering them. Thus it ensures that you can never inject anything that’s not explicitly written in your application. Everything is converted to a string before being rendered. This helps prevent XSS (cross-site-scripting) attacks. - Which characters need to be escaped in HTML inserting text content in your document in a location where text content is expected By \"a location where text content is expected\", I mean inside of an element or quoted attribute value where normal parsing rules apply. For example: HERE or .... Inside of an element, this just includes the entity escape ampersand & and the element delimiter less-than and greater-than signs < >: & becomes &amp; < becomes &lt; > becomes &gt; Inside of attribute values you must also escape the quote character you're using: \" becomes &quot; ' becomes ' I encourage you to escape all five in all cases to reduce the chance of making a mistake. In general, you should not escape spaces as &nbsp;. &nbsp; is not a normal space, it's a non-breaking space. You can use these instead of normal spaces to prevent a line break from being inserted between two words, or to insert extra space without it being automatically collapsed, but this is usually a rare case. Don't do this unless you have a design constraint that requires it. - ! content that has special parsing rules or meaning, such as inside of a script or style tag, or as an element or attribute name. For example: `..., NOT-HERE, NOT-HERE, or ....` In these contexts, the rules are more complicated and it's much easier to introduce a security vulnerability. I strongly discourage you from ever inserting dynamic content in any of these locations. There's usually a safer alternative, such as putting the dynamic value in an attribute and then handling it with JavaScript. - JSX Represents Objects Babel compiles JSX down to React.createElement() calls. These two examples are identical: 1234567891011121314151617181920const element = ( &lt;h1 className=&quot;greeting&quot;&gt; Hello, world! &lt;/h1&gt;);const element = React.createElement( 'h1', {className: 'greeting'}, 'Hello, world!');React.createElement() performs a few checks to help you write bug-free code but essentially it creates an object like this:// Note: this structure is simplifiedconst element = { type: 'h1', props: { className: 'greeting', children: 'Hello, world!' }}; These objects are called “React elements”. You can think of them as descriptions of what you want to see on the screen. ### Rendering an Element into the DOM Let’s say there is a somewhere in your HTML file: `` We call this a “root” DOM node because everything inside it will be managed by React DOM. Applications built with just React usually have a single root DOM node. If you are integrating React into an existing app, you may have as many isolated root DOM nodes as you like. To render a React element, first pass the DOM element to ReactDOM.createRoot(), then pass the React element to root.render(): 12345const root = ReactDOM.createRoot( document.getElementById('root'));const element = &lt;h1&gt;Hello, world&lt;/h1&gt;;root.render(element); ### Function and Class Components The simplest way to define a component is to write a JavaScript function: function Welcome(props) { return Hello, {props.name}; } This function is a valid React component because it accepts a single “props” (which stands for properties) object argument with data and returns a React element. We call such components “function components” because they are literally JavaScript functions. You can also use an ES6 class to define a component: 12345class Welcome extends React.Component { render() { return &lt;h1&gt;Hello, {this.props.name}&lt;/h1&gt;; }} The above two components are equivalent from React’s point of view. - Composing Components Components can refer to other components in their output. This lets us use the same component abstraction for any level of detail. A button, a form, a dialog, a screen: in React apps, all those are commonly expressed as components. For example, we can create an App component that renders Welcome many times: 12345678910111213function Welcome(props) { return &lt;h1&gt;Hello, {props.name}&lt;/h1&gt;;}function App() { return ( &lt;div&gt; &lt;Welcome name=&quot;Sara&quot; /&gt; &lt;Welcome name=&quot;Cahal&quot; /&gt; &lt;Welcome name=&quot;Edite&quot; /&gt; &lt;/div&gt; );} - Extracting Components Don’t be afraid to split components into smaller components. For example, consider this Comment component: 123456789101112131415161718192021function Comment(props) { return ( &lt;div className=&quot;Comment&quot;&gt; &lt;div className=&quot;UserInfo&quot;&gt; &lt;img className=&quot;Avatar&quot; src={props.author.avatarUrl} alt={props.author.name} /&gt; &lt;div className=&quot;UserInfo-name&quot;&gt; {props.author.name} &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div className=&quot;Comment-text&quot;&gt; {props.text} &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div className=&quot;Comment-date&quot;&gt; {formatDate(props.date)} &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; );} It accepts author (an object), text (a string), and date (a date) as props, and describes a comment on a social media website. This component can be tricky to change because of all the nesting, and it is also hard to reuse individual parts of it. Let’s extract a few components from it. First, we will extract Avatar: 12345678function Avatar(props) { return ( &lt;img className=&quot;Avatar&quot; src={props.user.avatarUrl} alt={props.user.name} /&gt; );} The Avatar doesn’t need to know that it is being rendered inside a Comment. This is why we have given its prop a more generic name: user rather than author. We recommend naming props from the component’s own point of view rather than the context in which it is being used. We can now simplify Comment a tiny bit: 123456789101112131415161718function Comment(props) { return ( &lt;div className=&quot;Comment&quot;&gt; &lt;div className=&quot;UserInfo&quot;&gt; &lt;Avatar user={props.author} /&gt; &lt;div className=&quot;UserInfo-name&quot;&gt; {props.author.name} &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div className=&quot;Comment-text&quot;&gt; {props.text} &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div className=&quot;Comment-date&quot;&gt; {formatDate(props.date)} &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; );} Next, we will extract a UserInfo component that renders an Avatar next to the user’s name: 12345678910function UserInfo(props) { return ( &lt;div className=&quot;UserInfo&quot;&gt; &lt;Avatar user={props.user} /&gt; &lt;div className=&quot;UserInfo-name&quot;&gt; {props.user.name} &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; );} This lets us simplify Comment even further: 12345678910111213function Comment(props) { return ( &lt;div className=&quot;Comment&quot;&gt; &lt;UserInfo user={props.author} /&gt; &lt;div className=&quot;Comment-text&quot;&gt; {props.text} &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div className=&quot;Comment-date&quot;&gt; {formatDate(props.date)} &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; );} - Props are Read-Only Whether you declare a component as a function or a class, it must never modify its own props. - Adding Local State to a Class - 123456789101112131415161718class Clock extends React.Component { constructor(props) { super(props); this.state = {date: new Date()}; } render() { return ( &lt;div&gt; &lt;h1&gt;Hello, world!&lt;/h1&gt; &lt;h2&gt;It is {this.state.date.toLocaleTimeString()}.&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;/div&gt; ); }}const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root'));root.render(&lt;Clock /&gt;); - Adding Lifecycle Methods to a Class We want to set up a timer whenever the Clock is rendered to the DOM for the first time. This is called “mounting” in React. We also want to clear that timer whenever the DOM produced by the Clock is removed. This is called “unmounting” in React. 1234567891011121314151617181920212223242526272829303132333435class Clock extends React.Component { constructor(props) { super(props); this.state = {date: new Date()}; } componentDidMount() { this.timerID = setInterval( () =&gt; this.tick(), 1000 ); } componentWillUnmount() { clearInterval(this.timerID); } tick() { this.setState({ date: new Date() }); } render() { return ( &lt;div&gt; &lt;h1&gt;Hello, world!&lt;/h1&gt; &lt;h2&gt;It is {this.state.date.toLocaleTimeString()}.&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;/div&gt; ); }}const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root'));root.render(&lt;Clock /&gt;); 1. When the Clock output is inserted in the DOM, React calls the componentDidMount() lifecycle method. Inside it, the Clock component asks the browser to set up a timer to call the component’s tick() method once a second. 2. Every second the browser calls the tick() method. Inside it, the Clock component schedules a UI update by calling setState() with an object containing the current time. 3. Thanks to the setState() call, React knows the state has changed, and calls the render() method again to learn what should be on the screen. This time, this.state.date in the render() method will be different, and so the render output will include the updated time. React updates the DOM accordingly. 4. If the Clock component is ever removed from the DOM, React calls the componentWillUnmount() lifecycle method so the timer is stopped. - State Updates May Be Asynchronous React may batch multiple setState() calls into a single update for performance. Because this.props and this.state may be updated asynchronously, you should not rely on their values for calculating the next state. For example, this code may fail to update the counter: // Wrong 123this.setState({ counter: this.state.counter + this.props.increment,}); To fix it, use a second form of setState() that accepts a function rather than an object. That function will receive the previous state as the first argument, and the props at the time the update is applied as the second argument: // Correct 123this.setState((state, props) =&gt; ({ counter: state.counter + props.increment})); ### Handling Events Handling events with React elements is very similar to handling events on DOM elements. There are some syntax differences: React events are named using camelCase, rather than lowercase. With JSX you pass a function as the event handler, rather than a string. - this You have to be careful about the meaning of this in JSX callbacks. In JavaScript, class methods are not bound by default. If you forget to bind this.handleClick and pass it to onClick, this will be undefined when the function is actually called. 1234567891011121314151617181920212223class Toggle extends React.Component { constructor(props) { super(props); this.state = {isToggleOn: true}; // This binding is necessary to make `this` work in the callback this.handleClick = this.handleClick.bind(this); } handleClick() { this.setState(prevState =&gt; ({ isToggleOn: !prevState.isToggleOn })); } render() { return ( &lt;button onClick={this.handleClick}&gt; {this.state.isToggleOn ? 'ON' : 'OFF'} &lt;/button&gt; ); }} use public class fields syntax to correctly bind callbacks: 12345678910111213class LoggingButton extends React.Component { // This syntax ensures `this` is bound within handleClick. handleClick = () =&gt; { console.log('this is:', this); }; render() { return ( &lt;button onClick={this.handleClick}&gt; Click me &lt;/button&gt; ); }} If you aren’t using class fields syntax, you can use an arrow function in the callback: 1234567891011121314class LoggingButton extends React.Component { handleClick() { console.log('this is:', this); } render() { // This syntax ensures `this` is bound within handleClick return ( &lt;button onClick={() =&gt; this.handleClick()}&gt; Click me &lt;/button&gt; ); }} The problem with this syntax is that a different callback is created each time the LoggingButton renders. In most cases, this is fine. However, if this callback is passed as a prop to lower components, those components might do an extra re-rendering. We generally recommend binding in the constructor or using the class fields syntax, to avoid this sort of performance problem. - Passing Arguments to Event Handlers Inside a loop, it is common to want to pass an extra parameter to an event handler. For example, if id is the row ID, either of the following would work: ` this.deleteRow(id, e)}>Delete Row` `Delete Row` The above two lines are equivalent, and use arrow functions and Function.prototype.bind respectively. In both cases, the e argument representing the React event will be passed as a second argument after the ID. With an arrow function, we have to pass it explicitly, but with bind any further arguments are automatically forwarded. - While declaring a variable and using an if statement is a fine way to conditionally render a component, sometimes you might want to use a shorter syntax - Inline If with Logical && Operator It works because in JavaScript, true && expression always evaluates to expression, and false && expression always evaluates to false. Therefore, if the condition is true, the element right after && will appear in the output. If it is false, React will ignore and skip it. Note that returning a falsy expression will still cause the element after && to be skipped but will return the falsy expression. In the example below, 0 will be returned by the render method. 12345678render() { const count = 0; return ( &lt;div&gt; {count &amp;&amp; &lt;h1&gt;Messages: {count}&lt;/h1&gt;} &lt;/div&gt; );} - Inline If-Else with Conditional Operator Another method for conditionally rendering elements inline is to use the JavaScript conditional operator condition ? true : false. Preventing Component from Rendering In rare cases you might want a component to hide itself even though it was rendered by another component. To do this return null instead of its render output. 1234567891011function WarningBanner(props) { if (!props.warn) { return null; } return ( &lt;div className=&quot;warning&quot;&gt; Warning! &lt;/div&gt; );} - Rendering Multiple Components You can build collections of elements and include them in JSX using curly braces {}. Below, we loop through the numbers array using the JavaScript map() function. We return a element for each item. Finally, we assign the resulting array of elements to listItems: const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]; const listItems = numbers.map((number) => {number} ); Then, we can include the entire listItems array inside a element: When you run code, you’ll be given a warning that a key should be provided for list items. A “key” is a special string attribute you need to include when creating lists of elements. 1234567891011function NumberList(props) { const numbers = props.numbers; const listItems = numbers.map((number) =&gt; &lt;li key={number.toString()}&gt; {number} &lt;/li&gt; ); return ( &lt;ul&gt;{listItems}&lt;/ul&gt; );} - Keys Keys help React identify which items have changed, are added, or are removed. Keys should be given to the elements inside the array to give the elements a stable identity: We don’t recommend using indexes for keys if the order of items may change. This can negatively impact performance and may cause issues with component state. Example: Incorrect Key Usage 12345678910111213141516171819202122function ListItem(props) { const value = props.value; return ( // Wrong! There is no need to specify the key here: &lt;li key={value.toString()}&gt; {value} &lt;/li&gt; );}function NumberList(props) { const numbers = props.numbers; const listItems = numbers.map((number) =&gt; // Wrong! The key should have been specified here: &lt;ListItem value={number} /&gt; ); return ( &lt;ul&gt; {listItems} &lt;/ul&gt; );} Example: Correct Key Usage 1234567891011121314151617function ListItem(props) { // Correct! There is no need to specify the key here: return &lt;li&gt;{props.value}&lt;/li&gt;;}function NumberList(props) { const numbers = props.numbers; const listItems = numbers.map((number) =&gt; // Correct! Key should be specified inside the array. &lt;ListItem key={number.toString()} value={number} /&gt; ); return ( &lt;ul&gt; {listItems} &lt;/ul&gt; );} - Embedding map() in JSX JSX allows embedding any expression in curly braces so we could inline the map() result: 1234567891011function NumberList(props) { const numbers = props.numbers; return ( &lt;ul&gt; {numbers.map((number) =&gt; &lt;ListItem key={number.toString()} value={number} /&gt; )} &lt;/ul&gt; );} - Composition vs Inheritance React has a powerful composition model, and we recommend using composition instead of inheritance to reuse code between components. - Containment Some components don’t know their children ahead of time. This is especially common for components like Sidebar or Dialog that represent generic “boxes”. We recommend that such components use the special children prop to pass children elements directly into their output: 1234567function FancyBorder(props) { return ( &lt;div className={'FancyBorder FancyBorder-' + props.color}&gt; {props.children} &lt;/div&gt; );} This lets other components pass arbitrary children to them by nesting the JSX: 123456789101112function WelcomeDialog() { return ( &lt;FancyBorder color=&quot;blue&quot;&gt; &lt;h1 className=&quot;Dialog-title&quot;&gt; Welcome &lt;/h1&gt; &lt;p className=&quot;Dialog-message&quot;&gt; Thank you for visiting our spacecraft! &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/FancyBorder&gt; );} Try it on CodePen Anything inside the JSX tag gets passed into the FancyBorder component as a children prop. Since FancyBorder renders {props.children} inside a , the passed elements appear in the final output. - sometimes you might need multiple “holes” in a component. In such cases you may come up with your own convention instead of using children: 123456789101112131415161718192021222324function SplitPane(props) { return ( &lt;div className=&quot;SplitPane&quot;&gt; &lt;div className=&quot;SplitPane-left&quot;&gt; {props.left} &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div className=&quot;SplitPane-right&quot;&gt; {props.right} &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; );}function App() { return ( &lt;SplitPane left={ &lt;Contacts /&gt; } right={ &lt;Chat /&gt; } /&gt; );} Try it on CodePen React elements like and are just objects, so you can pass them as props like any other data. This approach may remind you of “slots” in other libraries but there are no limitations on what you can pass as props in React. - Specialization Sometimes we think about components as being “special cases” of other components. For example, we might say that a WelcomeDialog is a special case of Dialog. 1234567891011121314151617181920212223242526272829303132333435363738394041424344function Dialog(props) { return ( &lt;FancyBorder color=&quot;blue&quot;&gt; &lt;h1 className=&quot;Dialog-title&quot;&gt; {props.title} &lt;/h1&gt; &lt;p className=&quot;Dialog-message&quot;&gt; {props.message} &lt;/p&gt; {props.children} &lt;/FancyBorder&gt; );}class SignUpDialog extends React.Component { constructor(props) { super(props); this.handleChange = this.handleChange.bind(this); this.handleSignUp = this.handleSignUp.bind(this); this.state = {login: ''}; } render() { return ( &lt;Dialog title=&quot;Mars Exploration Program&quot; message=&quot;How should we refer to you?&quot;&gt; &lt;input value={this.state.login} onChange={this.handleChange} /&gt; &lt;button onClick={this.handleSignUp}&gt; Sign Me Up! &lt;/button&gt; &lt;/Dialog&gt; ); } handleChange(e) { this.setState({login: e.target.value}); } handleSignUp() { alert(`Welcome aboard, ${this.state.login}!`); }}","link":"/lucfe-hexo/0004%20Formal%20science/%E8%AE%A1%E7%AE%97%E6%9C%BA%E7%A7%91%E5%AD%A6%E6%8A%80%E6%9C%AF%20Computer%20science/Software%20notations%C2%A0and%C2%A0tools/html%20css%20js/react%20jsx%20wiki/"},{"title":"python crash course","text":"Getting StartedSetting up your Programming Environmentinstalling Pythonhttps://www.python.org/downloads/ run the installer.

We’ve added a variable named message. Every variable is connected to avalue, which is the information associated with that variable. 1234message = &quot;Hello Python world!&quot;print(message)message = &quot;Hello Python Crash Course world!&quot;print(message) output: 12Hello Python world!Hello Python Crash Course world! You can change the value of a variable in your program at any time,and Python will always keep track of its current value. Naming and Using Variablesrules: Variable names can contain only letters, numbers, and underscores.They can start with a letter or an underscore, but not with a number.For instance, you can call a variable message_1 but not 1_message. Spaces are not allowed in variable names, but underscores can be usedto separate words in variable names. For example, greeting_message worksbut greeting message will cause errors. Avoid using Python keywords and function names as variable names.For example, do not use the word print as a variable name; Pythonhas reserved it for a particular programmatic purpose. (See “PythonKeywords and Built-in Functions” on page 466.) Variable names should be short but descriptive. For example, name isbetter than n, student_name is better than s_n, and name_length is betterthan length_of_persons_name. Be careful when using the lowercase letter l and the uppercase letter Obecause they could be confused with the numbers 1 and 0. The Python variables you’re using at this point should be lowercase. You won’t get errors if you use uppercase letters, but uppercase letters in variable names have special meanings that we’ll discuss in later chapters. Avoiding Name Errors When Using Variables12message = &quot;Hello Python Crash Course reader!&quot;print(mesage) When an error occurs in your program, The interpreter providesa traceback when a program cannot run successfully. A traceback is a record of where the interpreter ran into trouble when trying to execute your code. example: 12345Traceback (most recent call last):File &quot;hello_world.py&quot;, line 2, in &lt;module&gt; # 1 print(mesage) # 2 ^^^^^^NameError: name 'mesage' is not defined. Did you mean: 'message'? # 3 The output reports that an error occurs in line 2 of the file hello_world.py and tells us what kind of error it found 3.In this case it found a name errorand reports that the variable being printed, mesage, has not been defined. A name error usually means we either forgot to set a variable’s value before using it, or we made a spelling mistake when entering the variable’s name. If Python finds a variable name that’s similar to the one it doesn’t recognize, it will ask if that’s the name you meant to use. Variables Are Labels It’s much better to think of variables as labels that you can assign to values. You canalso say that a variable references a certain value. StringsA string is a series of characters.Anything inside quotes is considered a string in Python, and you can use single or double quotes around your strings like this: “This is a string.”‘This is also a string.’ use quotes and apostrophes within your strings: ‘I told my friend, “Python is my favorite language!”‘“The language ‘Python’ is named after Monty Python, not the snake.”“One of Python’s strengths is its diverse and supportive community.” Changing Case in a String with Methodsstring.title() Return a version of the string where each word is titlecased.More specifically, words start with uppercased characters and all remaining cased characters have lower case. 12name = &quot;ada lovelace&quot;print(name.title()) output:Ada Lovelace A method is an action that Python can perform on a piece of data. The dot (.) after name in name.title() tells Python to make the title() method act on the variable name. Every method is followed by a set of parentheses, becausemethods often need additional information to do their work. That information is provided inside the parentheses. The title() function doesn’t needany additional information, so its parentheses are empty. change a string to all uppercase or all lowercase letters like this: 123name = &quot;Ada Lovelace&quot;print(name.upper())print(name.lower()) This will display the following: ADA LOVELACEada lovelace The lower() method is particularly useful for storing data. You typically won’t want to trust the capitalization that your users provide, so you’ll convert strings to lowercase before storing them. Then when you want to display the information, you’ll use the case that makes the most sense foreach string. Using Variables in Stringsuse a variable’s value inside a string: 1234first_name = &quot;ada&quot;last_name = &quot;lovelace&quot;full_name = f&quot;{first_name} {last_name}&quot; # 1print(full_name) place the letter f immediatelybefore the opening quotation mark 1. Put braces around the name ornames of any variable you want to use inside the string. These strings are called f-strings. The f is for format, because Pythonformats the string by replacing the name of any variable in braces with itsvalue. The output from the previous code is:ada lovelace another example: 1234first_name = &quot;ada&quot;last_name = &quot;lovelace&quot;full_name = f&quot;{first_name} {last_name}&quot;print(f&quot;Hello, {full_name.title()}!&quot;) # 1 output: Hello, Ada Lovelace! Adding Whitespace to Strings with Tabs or Newlineswhitespace refers to any nonprinting characters, such asspaces, tabs, and end-of-line symbols.use whitespace to organize your output so it’s easier for users to read. a tab \\t: 1234&gt;&gt;&gt; print(&quot;Python&quot;)Python&gt;&gt;&gt; print(&quot;\\tPython&quot;) Python newline \\n: 12345&gt;&gt;&gt; print(&quot;Languages:\\nPython\\nC\\nJavaScript&quot;)Languages:PythonCJavaScript combine tabs and newlines: 12345&gt;&gt;&gt; print(&quot;Languages:\\n\\tPython\\n\\tC\\n\\tJavaScript&quot;)Languages: Python C JavaScript Stripping Whitespace‘python’ and ‘python ‘ to a program, they are two different strings. often you’ll want to compare two strings to determine whether they are the same. Extra whitespace can be confusing in much simpler situations as well. eliminate extra whitespace from data that people enter. To ensure that no whitespace exists at the right side of a string, usethe rstrip() method: 1234567&gt;&gt;&gt; favorite_language = 'python ' # 1&gt;&gt;&gt; favorite_language # 2'python '&gt;&gt;&gt; favorite_language.rstrip() # 3'python'&gt;&gt;&gt; favorite_language # 4'python ' However, it is only removed temporarily. If you ask for the valueof favorite_language again, the string looks the same as when it was entered,including the extra whitespace 4.To remove the whitespace from the string permanently, you have toassociate the stripped value with the variable name: 1234&gt;&gt;&gt; favorite_language = 'python '&gt;&gt;&gt; favorite_language = favorite_language.rstrip() # 1&gt;&gt;&gt; favorite_language'python' strip whitespace from the left side of a string using the lstrip() methodfrom both sides at once using strip(): 1234567&gt;&gt;&gt; favorite_language = ' python ' # 1 &gt;&gt;&gt; favorite_language.rstrip() # 2 ' python'&gt;&gt;&gt; favorite_language.lstrip() # 3 'python '&gt;&gt;&gt; favorite_language.strip() # 4 'python' In the real world, these stripping functions are used most often to clean upuser input before it’s stored in a program. Removing Prefixesremove a prefix. 123&gt;&gt;&gt; nostarch_url = 'https://nostarch.com'&gt;&gt;&gt; nostarch_url.removeprefix('https://')'nostarch.com' Enter the name of the variable followed by a dot, and then the methodremoveprefix(). Inside the parentheses, enter the prefix you want to removefrom the original string. Like the methods for removing whitespace, removeprefix() leaves theoriginal string unchanged. If you want to keep the new value with the prefix removed, either reassign it to the original variable or assign it to a newvariable: &gt;&gt;&gt; simple_url = nostarch_url.removeprefix('https://') Avoiding Syntax Errors with StringsA syntax error occurs when Python doesn’t recognize a section of your program as valid Python code. example 12message = 'One of Python's strengths is its diverse community.'print(message) You’ll see the following output: 1234File &quot;apostrophe.py&quot;, line 1message = 'One of Python's strengths is its diverse community.'1 ^SyntaxError: unterminated string literal (detected at line 1) Your editor’s syntax highlighting feature should help you spot some syntax errors quickly as you write your programs. If you see Python code highlighted as if it’s English or English highlighted as if it’s Python code, you probably have a mismatched quotation mark somewhere in your file. NumbersIntegersYou can add (+), subtract (-), multiply (*), and divide (/) integers in Python. 12345678&gt;&gt;&gt; 2 + 35&gt;&gt;&gt; 3 - 21&gt;&gt;&gt; 2 * 36&gt;&gt;&gt; 3 / 21.5 uses two multiplication symbols to represent exponents: 123456&gt;&gt;&gt; 3 ** 29&gt;&gt;&gt; 3 ** 327&gt;&gt;&gt; 10 ** 61000000 Python supports the order of operations too, so you can use multipleoperations in one expression. You can also use parentheses to modify theorder of operations. For example: 1234&gt;&gt;&gt; 2 + 3*414&gt;&gt;&gt; (2 + 3) * 420 The spacing in these examples has no effect on how Python evaluates the expressions; it simply helps you more quickly spot the operations that have priority when you’re reading through the code. FloatsPython calls any number with a decimal point a float. it refers to the fact that a decimal point Variables and can appear at any position in a number. For the most part, you can use floats without worrying about how theybehave. Simply enter the numbers you want to use, and Python will mostlikely do what you expect: 12345678&gt;&gt;&gt; 0.1 + 0.10.2&gt;&gt;&gt; 0.2 + 0.20.4&gt;&gt;&gt; 2 *0.10.2&gt;&gt;&gt; 2* 0.20.4 However, be aware that you can sometimes get an arbitrary number ofdecimal places in your answer: 1234&gt;&gt;&gt; 0.2 + 0.10.30000000000000004&gt;&gt;&gt; 3 * 0.10.30000000000000004 This happens in all languages and is of little concern. Python tries tofind a way to represent the result as precisely as possible, which is sometimesdifficult given how computers have to represent numbers internally. Integers and FloatsWhen you divide any two numbers, even if they are integers that result in awhole number, you’ll always get a float: 12&gt;&gt;&gt; 4/22.0 If you mix an integer and a float in any other operation, you’ll get afloat as well: 123456&gt;&gt;&gt; 1 + 2.03.0&gt;&gt;&gt; 2 * 3.06.0&gt;&gt;&gt; 3.0 ** 29.0 Python defaults to a float in any operation that uses a float, even if theoutput is a whole number. Underscores in NumbersWhen you’re writing long numbers, you can group digits using underscoresto make large numbers more readable: 123&gt;&gt;&gt; universe_age = 14_000_000_000&gt;&gt;&gt; print(universe_age)14000000000 Python ignores the underscores when storing these kinds of values. Even if you don’t group the digits in threes, the value will still be unaffected. To Python, 1000 is the same as 1_000, which is the same as 10_00. Thisfeature works for both integers and floats. Multiple AssignmentYou can assign values to more than one variable using just a single line ofcode. This can help shorten your programs and make them easier to read; you’ll use this technique most often when initializing a set of numbers.For example, here’s how you can initialize the variables x, y, and z to zero: &gt;&gt;&gt; x, y, z = 0, 0, 0 You need to separate the variable names with commas, and do the samewith the values, and Python will assign each value to its respective variable.As long as the number of values matches the number of variables, Pythonwill match them up correctly ConstantsA constant is a variable whose value stays the same throughout the life of aprogram. Python doesn’t have built-in constant types, but Python programmers use all capital letters to indicate a variable should be treated as a constant and never be changed: MAX_CONNECTIONS = 5000 Commentsu should add notes within your programs that describe your overall approach to theproblem you’re solving. A comment allows you to write notes in your spokenlanguage, within your programs. How Do You Write Comments?In Python, the hash mark (#) indicates a comment. Anything following ahash mark in your code is ignored by the Python interpreter. For example: 12# Say hello to everyone.print(&quot;Hello Python people!&quot;) Python ignores the first line and executes the second line.Hello Python people! Introducing Listswhat is a listA list is a collection of items in a particular order Because a list usually contains more than one element, it’s a good idea to make the name of your list plural, such as letters, digits, or names In Python, square brackets ([]) indicate a list, and individual elements in the list are separated by commas.example 12bicycles = ['trek', 'cannondale', 'redline', 'specialized']print(bicycles) output:['trek', 'cannondale', 'redline', 'specialized'] Accessing Elements in a ListLists are ordered collections, so you can access any element in a list bytelling Python the position, or index, of the item desired. To access an element in a list, write the name of the list followed by the index of the itemenclosed in square brackets. 12bicycles = ['trek', 'cannondale', 'redline', 'specialized']print(bicycles[0]) outputtrek Index Positions Start at 0, Not 1Python has a special syntax for accessing the last element in a list. If youask for the item at index -1, Python always returns the last item in the list: 123bicycles = ['trek', 'cannondale', 'redline', 'specialized']print(bicycles[-1]) The index -2 returns the second item from the end of the list, the index -3 returns the third item from the end, and so forth. Using Individual Values from a ListYou can use individual values from a list just as you would any other variable. 123bicycles = ['trek', 'cannondale', 'redline', 'specialized']message = f&quot;My first bicycle was a {bicycles[0].title()}.&quot;print(message) Modifying, Adding, and Removing ElementsMost lists you create will be dynamic, meaning you’ll build a list and thenadd and remove elements from it as your program runs its course. Modifying Elements in a ListTo change an element, use the name of the list followedby the index of the element you want to change, and then provide the newvalue you want that item to have. 1234motorcycles = ['honda', 'yamaha', 'suzuki']print(motorcycles)motorcycles[0] = 'ducati'print(motorcycles) output[‘honda’, ‘yamaha’, ‘suzuki’][‘ducati’, ‘yamaha’, ‘suzuki’] Adding Elements to a ListAppending Elements to the End of a Listappend the item to thelist. When you append an item to a list, the new element is added to the endof the list 1234motorcycles = ['honda', 'yamaha', 'suzuki']print(motorcycles)motorcycles.append('ducati')print(motorcycles) To put your users in control, start by defining an empty list thatwill hold the users’ values. Then append each new value provided to the listyou just created. For example, 12345motorcycles = []motorcycles.append('honda')motorcycles.append('yamaha')motorcycles.append('suzuki')print(motorcycles) output[‘honda’, ‘yamaha’, ‘suzuki’] Inserting Elements into a ListYou can add a new element at any position in your list by using the insert()method. You do this by specifying the index of the new element and thevalue of the new item:This operation shifts every other value in the list one position to theright. 123motorcycles = ['honda', 'yamaha', 'suzuki']motorcycles.insert(0, 'ducati')print(motorcycles) output[ducati’, ‘honda’, ‘yamaha’, ‘suzuki’] Removing Elements from a ListRemoving an Item Using the del Statementknow the position of the item you want to remove from a list, you canuse the del statement: motorcycles = [‘honda’, ‘yamaha’, ‘suzuki’]print(motorcycles)del motorcycles[0]print(motorcycles) Removing an Item Using the pop() MethodThe pop() method removes the last item in a list, but it lets you workwith that item after removing it. The term pop comes from thinking of alist as a stack of items and popping one item off the top of the stack. In thisanalogy, the top of a stack corresponds to the end of a list. 12345motorcycles = ['honda', 'yamaha', 'suzuki']print(motorcycles)popped_motorcycle = motorcycles.pop()print(motorcycles)print(popped_motorcycle) [‘honda’, ‘yamaha’, ‘suzuki’][‘honda’, ‘yamaha’]suzuki Popping Items from Any Position in a List123motorcycles = ['honda', 'yamaha', 'suzuki']first_owned = motorcycles.pop(0)print(f&quot;The first motorcycle I owned was a {first_owned.title()}.&quot;) The first motorcycle I owned was a Honda. Remember that each time you use pop(), the item you work with is nolonger stored in the list. when you want to delete an item from a list and not use that item in any way, use the del statement; if you want to use an item as you remove it, use the pop() method. Removing an Item by ValueIf you only know the value of the item you want to remove, youcan use the remove() method 1234motorcycles = ['honda', 'yamaha', 'suzuki', 'ducati']print(motorcycles)motorcycles.remove('ducati')print(motorcycles) [‘honda’, ‘yamaha’, ‘suzuki’, ‘ducati’][‘honda’, ‘yamaha’, ‘suzuki’] The remove() method deletes only the first occurrence of the value you specify. If there’s a possibility the value appears more than once in the list, you’ll need to use a loop to make sure all occurrences of the value are removed. Organizing a ListSometimes you’ll wantto preserve the original order of your list, and other times you’ll want tochange the original order. Sorting a List Permanently with the sort() MethodThe sort() method changes the order of the list permanently. The carsare now in alphabetical order, and we can never revert to the original order: 123cars = ['bmw', 'audi', 'toyota', 'subaru']cars.sort()print(cars) [‘audi’, ‘bmw’, ‘subaru’, ‘toyota’] o sort this list in reverse-alphabetical order 123cars = ['bmw', 'audi', 'toyota', 'subaru']cars.sort(reverse=True)print(cars) [‘toyota’, ‘subaru’, ‘bmw’, ‘audi’] Sorting a List Temporarily with the sorted() FunctionThe sorted() function lets you display your listin a particular order, but doesn’t affect the actual order of the list. 1234567cars = ['bmw', 'audi', 'toyota', 'subaru']print(&quot;Here is the original list:&quot;)print(cars)print(&quot;\\nHere is the sorted list:&quot;)print(sorted(cars))print(&quot;\\nHere is the original list again:&quot;)print(cars) output: Here is the original list:[‘bmw’, ‘audi’, ‘toyota’, ‘subaru’]Here is the sorted list:[‘audi’, ‘bmw’, ‘subaru’, ‘toyota’]1 Here is the original list again:[‘bmw’, ‘audi’, ‘toyota’, ‘subaru’] The sorted() function can also accept a reverse=Trueargument if you want to display a list in reverse-alphabetical order. Sorting a list alphabetically is a bit more complicated when all the values are not in lowercase Printing a List in Reverse OrderIf we originally stored the list of cars in chronological order according to whenwe owned them, we could easily rearrange the list into reverse-chronologicalorder: 1234cars = ['bmw', 'audi', 'toyota', 'subaru']print(cars)cars.reverse()print(cars) [‘bmw’, ‘audi’, ‘toyota’, ‘subaru’][‘subaru’, ‘toyota’, ‘audi’, ‘bmw’] Finding the Length of a List cars = [‘bmw’, ‘audi’, ‘toyota’, ‘subaru’]len(cars) Avoiding Index Errors When Working with Lists12motorcycles = ['honda', 'yamaha', 'suzuki']print(motorcycles[3]) This example results in an index error: 12345Traceback (most recent call last): File &quot;motorcycles.py&quot;, line 2, in &lt;module&gt; print(motorcycles[3]) ~~~~~~~~~~~^^^IndexError: list index out of range Keep in mind that whenever you want to access the last item in a list,you should use the index -1. This will always work, even if your list haschanged size since the last time you accessed it: motorcycles = [‘honda’, ‘yamaha’, ‘suzuki’]print(motorcycles[-1]) output: suzuki The only time this approach will cause an error is when you request thelast item from an empty list: 12motorcycles = []print(motorcycles[-1]) No items are in motorcycles, so Python returns another index error: 123456Traceback (most recent call last): File &quot;motorcyles.py&quot;, line 3, in &lt;module&gt; print(motorcycles[-1]) ~~~~~~~~~~~^^^^IndexError: list index out of range If an index error occurs and you can’t figure out how to resolve it, tryprinting your list or just printing the length of your list. Your list might lookmuch different than you thought it did, especially if it has been manageddynamically by your program. Seeing the actual list, or the exact number ofitems in your list, can help you sort out such logical errors. Working with ListsLooping allows you to take the same action, or setof actions, with every item in a list Looping Through an Entire ListSay we have a list of magicians’ names, and we want to print out each name in the list. We could do this by retrieving each name from the list individually, but this approach could cause several problems. For one, it wouldbe repetitive to do this with a long list of names. Also, we’d have to changeour code each time the list’s length changed. Using a for loop avoids both ofthese issues by letting Python manage these issues internally. 123magicians = ['alice', 'david', 'carolina']for magician in magicians: print(magician) alicedavidcarolina A Closer Look at Loopingfor magician in magicians: This line tells Python to retrieve the first value from the list magicians and associate it with the variable magician. the set of steps is repeated once for each item in the list, no matter how many itemsare in the list. you can chooseany name you want for the temporary variable that will be associated witheach value in the list. However, it’s helpful to choose a meaningful namethat represents a single item from the list. Using singular and plural names can helpyou identify whether a section of code is working with a single element fromthe list or the entire list. Doing More Work Within a for Loop1234magicians = ['alice', 'david', 'carolina']for magician in magicians: print(f&quot;{magician.title()}, that was a great trick!&quot;) print(f&quot;I can't wait to see your next trick, {magician.title()}.\\n&quot;) Alice, that was a great trick!I can’t wait to see your next trick, Alice. David, that was a great trick!I can’t wait to see your next trick, David. Carolina, that was a great trick!I can’t wait to see your next trick, Carolina. Doing Something After a for LoopAny lines of code after the for loop that are not indented are executedonce without repetition. 12345magicians = ['alice', 'david', 'carolina']for magician in magicians: print(f&quot;{magician.title()}, that was a great trick!&quot;) print(f&quot;I can't wait to see your next trick, {magician.title()}.\\n&quot;)print(&quot;Thank you, everyone. That was a great magic show!&quot;) Alice, that was a great trick!I can’t wait to see your next trick, Alice. David, that was a great trick!Working with Lists 53I can’t wait to see your next trick, David. Carolina, that was a great trick!I can’t wait to see your next trick, Carolina. Thank you, everyone. That was a great magic show! Avoiding Indentation ErrorsPython uses indentation to determine how a line, or group of lines, is relatedto the rest of the program. common indentation errors. For example, peoplesometimes indent lines of code that don’t need to be indented or forgetto indent lines that need to be indented. Forgetting to Indent123magicians = ['alice', 'david', 'carolina']for magician in magicians:print(magician) 1234File &quot;magicians.py&quot;, line 3 print(magician) ^IndentationError: expected an indented block after 'for' statement on line 2 Forgetting to Indent Additional LinesThis is a logical error. The syntax is valid Python code, but the code doesnot produce the desired result because a problem occurs in its logic. If youexpect to see a certain action repeated once for each item in a list and it’sexecuted only once, determine whether you need to simply indent a line ora group of lines. 1234magicians = ['alice', 'david', 'carolina']for magician in magicians: print(f&quot;{magician.title()}, that was a great trick!&quot;)print(f&quot;I can't wait to see your next trick, {magician.title()}.\\n&quot;) output: Alice, that was a great trick!David, that was a great trick!Carolina, that was a great trick!I can’t wait to see your next trick, Carolina. Indenting Unnecessarily12message = &quot;Hello Python world!&quot; print(message) File “hello_world.py”, line 2 print(message) ^IndentationError: unexpected indent You can avoid unexpected indentation errors by indenting only when you have a specific reason to do so. Indenting Unnecessarily After the Loop12345magicians = ['alice', 'david', 'carolina']for magician in magicians: print(f&quot;{magician.title()}, that was a great trick!&quot;) print(f&quot;I can't wait to see your next trick, {magician.title()}.\\n&quot;) print(&quot;Thank you everyone, that was a great magic show!&quot;) 123456789101112Alice, that was a great trick!I can't wait to see your next trick, Alice.Thank you everyone, that was a great magic show!David, that was a great trick!I can't wait to see your next trick, David.Thank you everyone, that was a great magic show!Carolina, that was a great trick!I can't wait to see your next trick, Carolina.Thank you everyone, that was a great magic show! This is another logical error, similar to the one in “Forgetting to IndentAdditional Lines” on page 54. Because Python doesn’t know what you’retrying to accomplish with your code, it will run all code that is written invalid syntax. If an action is repeated many times when it should be executedonly once, you probably need to unindent the code for that action.

The npm command (provided by Node.js) will create one for you with npm init -y. -y tells npm to use default values and skips the command line questionnaire. npm init -y INSTALL ELEVENTY@11ty/eleventy is published on npm and we can install and save it into our project’s package.json by running: npm install @11ty/eleventy --save-devYou may also install Eleventy globally but the package.json installation method above is recommended. RUN ELEVENTYWe can use the npx command (also provided by Node.js) to run our local project’s version of Eleventy. Let’s make sure our installation went okay and try to run Eleventy: npx @11ty/eleventy CREATE SOME TEMPLATESA template is a content file written in a format such as Markdown, HTML, Liquid, Nunjucks, and more, which Eleventy transforms into a page (or pages) when building our site. Let’s run two commands to create two new template files. 12echo '&lt;!doctype html&gt;&lt;title&gt;Page title&lt;/title&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hi&lt;/p&gt;' &gt; index.htmlecho '# Page header' &gt; README.md Alternatively, you can create these using any text editor—just make sure you save them into your project folder and they have the correct file extensions. After you’ve created an HTML template and a Markdown template, let’s run Eleventy again with the following command:npx @11ty/eleventyThe output might look like this: 12345npx @11ty/eleventy[11ty] Writing _site/README/index.html from ./README.md (liquid)[11ty] Writing _site/index.html from ./index.html (liquid)[11ty] Wrote 2 files in 0.04 seconds (v2.0.1)We’ve compiled our two content templates in the current directory into the output folder (_site is the default).

When you save your template files—Eleventy will refresh the browser with your new changes automatically! USE A BUILD SCRIPTWhen deploying your Eleventy site, the goal is to provide your chosen host with your project’s build output (the _site folder by default). The command you run is usually configured via a build script in your package.json file. It might look like this: DEPOLY ON GITHUB PAGES.0BFILENAME package.json 123456{ &quot;scripts&quot;: { &quot;build&quot;: &quot;npx @11ty/eleventy&quot; }} New files in your GitHub repo.nojekyll file: Open a plain-text editor and save an empty file in the root of your repo (where you have the .eleventy.js) with the filename .nojekyll. This will stop GitHub from trying to build your site as a Jekyll site. .github directory: Create a new directory in the root of your repo and name it .github (yes, starting with a period). Inside that directory, make a directory named workflows. Open a plain-text editor and save a file inside the workflows directory called build.yml. Copy the contents from my build.yml file here.Note: my build.yml file was updated 6/14/23 with Node version improvements thanks to Simon Wiles 12345678910111213141516171819202122232425262728293031323334name: Build Eleventyon: push: branches: - mainjobs: build: runs-on: ubuntu-latest steps: - uses: actions/checkout@v3 - name: Use Node.js current uses: actions/setup-node@v3 with: node-version: current - name: Install dependencies &amp; build run: | npm ci npm run build - name: Deploy uses: peaceiris/actions-gh-pages@v3.8.0 with: github_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }} #publish_dir is the folder on the docker instance which eleventy builds the pages to. #it is not the docs folder in the repository publish_dir: _site #publish_branch is the branch in the repository. #this is where you need to point GitHub pages publish_branch: gh-pages Depending on your Eleventy setup, you may need to change publish_dir in your build.yml file. My Eleventy site builds to a folder called dist. If yours builds to a folder with a different name, change it in this file. GitHub configurationCreating a gh-pages branchUsing the GitHub interface, you’ll need to create a new branch of your repo called gh-pages where the built version of your site will be hosted from. If you’re looking at your repo on GitHub, you should see a little button that says main towards the upper left, under the &lt;&gt; Code tab. Click that button, then type gh-pages into the field that says Find or create a branch. This will create a new branch called gh-pages important!!!!the gh-pages branch will be update by the github page action definded up right in the workflow. so dont use the gh-pages branch for editing content Actions configurationGo into the settings for your repo, click on Actions in the set of tabs on the left, then General. Make sure that “Allow all actions and reusable workflows” is selected, and at the bottom of that page, under Workflow permissions make sure that you have “Read and write permissions” selected. GitHub Pages configurationGo into the settings for your repo, and click on “Pages” in the set of tabs on the left. Use the dropdown under Source to choose the gh-pages branch. Building the sitePermalinkIn theory, if you’ve set up all these things, anytime you push changes to GitHub, it will trigger an action that will build the site and move those files to the GitHub Pages hosting environment. If everything isn’t set up just right, you’ll get an email that an action failed. Click the “View workflow run” link in the email, which will take you to a page with information on the failed workflow. Click on the text in the middle panel where you see a red circle with an x – what the text says depends on where exactly it failed. Eventually you’ll see text reflecting where exactly the process failed, and you can search parts of that error message to figure out what’s going wrong. layoutEleventy Layouts are special templates that can be used to wrap other content. firstTo denote that a piece of content should be wrapped in a template, use the layout key in your front matter, like so: content-using-layout.md 12345678---layout: &quot;layouts/mylayout.njk&quot;title: My Rad Markdown Blog Post---`# {{ title }}` This will look for a mylayout.njk Nunjucks file in your includes folder at _includes/layouts/mylayout.njk. Next, we need to create a mylayout.njk file. It can contain any type of text, but here we’re using HTML:FILENAME _includes/mylayout.njk 1234567891011121314151617181920{% raw %}---title: My Rad Blog---&lt;!doctype html&gt;&lt;html lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt; &lt;head&gt; &lt;meta charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt; &lt;meta name=&quot;viewport&quot; content=&quot;width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0&quot;&gt; &lt;title&gt;{{ title }}&lt;/title&gt; &lt;/head&gt; &lt;body&gt;{% raw %} {{ content | safe }}{% endraw %} &lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;{% endraw %} If you are using a language that contains curly braces, you will likely need to place and tags around your code. Since Jekyll 4.0 , you can add render_with_liquid: false in your front matter to disable Liquid entirely for a particular document. Note that the layout template will populate the content data with the child template’s content. Also note that we don’t want to double-escape the output, so we’re using the provided Nunjucks safe filter here (see more language double-escaping syntax below). FRONT MATTER DATA IN LAYOUTSLayouts can contain their own front matter data! It’ll be merged with the content’s data on render. Content data takes precedence(优先), if conflicting keys arise. Front matter data set in a content template takes priority over layout front matter! Chained layouts have similar merge behavior. The closer to the content, the higher priority the data. SOURCES OF DATAWhen the data is merged in the Eleventy Data Cascade, the order of priority for sources of data is (from highest priority to lowest): Computed Data Front Matter Data in a Template Template Data Files Directory Data Files (and ascending Parent Directories) Front Matter Data in Layouts (this moved in 1.0) ⬅ Configuration API Global Data Global Data Files","link":"/lucfe-hexo/0004%20Formal%20science/%E8%AE%A1%E7%AE%97%E6%9C%BA%E7%A7%91%E5%AD%A6%E6%8A%80%E6%9C%AF%20Computer%20science/Software%20notations%C2%A0and%C2%A0tools/ssg/11ty_wiki/"},{"title":"","text":"ejshttps://ejs.co EJS is a simple templating language that lets you generate HTML markup with plain JavaScript.

VariablesBesides the following variables, you can use any attributes in the permalink. :category -&gt; Categories. If the post is uncategorized, it will use the default_category value. eg Changepermalink: ':year/:month/:day/:title/'topermalink: ':title/' Global Asset FolderGlobal Asset FolderAssets are non-post files in the source folder, such as images, CSS or JavaScript files. For instance, If you are only going to have a few images in the Hexo project, then the easiest way is to keep them in a source/images directory. Then, you can access them using something like ![](/images/image.jpg). For vscode copy imagesUse vscode open the source folder as project folder to create and edit the posts change the the image relative path linkassets/images/&lt;post title&gt;/*.jpgor../../assets/images/&lt;post title&gt;/*.jpgto the project directory absolute path link/assets/images/&lt;post title&gt;/*.jpg dont use Post Asset Folderor any kind of post asset image link plugin, there are lots of bugs! hexo serverWith the release of Hexo 3, the server has been separated from the main module. To start using the server, you will first have to install hexo-server. $ npm install hexo-server --save Once the server has been installed, run the following command to start the server. Your website will run at http://localhost:4000 by default. When the server is running, Hexo will watch for file changes and update automatically so it’s not necessary to manually restart the server. $ hexo server Static ModeIn static mode, only files in the public folder will be served and file watching is disabled. You have to run hexo generate before starting the server. Usually used in production. $ hexo server -s Git deploy Install hexo-deployer-git.$ npm install hexo-deployer-git --save Edit _config.yml (with example values shown below as comments): 12345deploy: type: git repo: &lt;repository url&gt; # https://bitbucket.org/JohnSmith/johnsmith.bitbucket.io branch: [branch] message: [message] Option Description Default repo URL of the target repository branch Branch name. gh-pages (GitHub) message Customize commit message.

Scaffold folder. When you create a new post, Hexo bases the new file on the scaffold. sourceSource folder. This is where you put your site’s content. Hexo ignores hidden files and files or folders whose names are prefixed with _ (underscore)- except the _posts folder. Renderable files (e.g. Markdown, HTML) will be processed and put into the public folder, while other files will simply be copied. themesTheme folder. Hexo generates a static website by combining the site contents with the theme. writingTo create a new post or a new page, you can run the following command: $ hexo new [layout] &lt;title&gt;post is the default layout, but you can supply your own. LayoutThere are three default layouts in Hexo: post, page and draft. Files created by each of them is saved to a different path. Newly created posts are saved to the source/_posts folder. FilenameBy default, Hexo uses the post title as its filename. You can edit the new_post_name setting in _config.yml to change the default filename. DraftsPreviously, we mentioned a special layout in Hexo: draft. Posts initialized with this layout are saved to the source/_drafts folder.Drafts are not displayed by default. You can add the –draft option when running Hexo or enable the render_drafts setting in _config.yml to render drafts. You can use the publish command to move drafts to the source/_posts folder. publish works in a similar way to the new command. $ hexo publish [layout] &lt;title&gt; You can use the publish command to move drafts to the source/_posts folder. publish works in a similar way to the new command. Supported FormatsHexo support posts written in any format, as long as the corresponding renderer plugin is installed. For example, Hexo has hexo-renderer-marked and hexo-renderer-ejs installed by default, so you can write your posts in markdown or in ejs. $ hexo publish [layout] &lt;title&gt; front matterFront-matter is a block of YAML or JSON at the beginning of the file that is used to configure settings for your writings. Front-matter is terminated by three dashes when written in YAML or three semicolons when written in JSON. YAML 12345---title: Hello Worlddate: 2013/7/13 20:46:25--- JSON “title”: “Hello World”,“date”: “2013/7/13 20:46:25”;;; Setting Description Defaultlayout Layout config.default_layouttitle Title Filename (posts only)date Published date File created datetags Tags (Not available for pages) categories Categories (Not available for pages) permalink Overrides the default permalink of the post. Permalink should end with / or .html null Categories &amp; TagsOnly posts support the use of categories and tags. Categories apply to posts in order, resulting in a hierarchy of classifications and sub-classifications. Tags are all defined on the same hierarchical level so the order in which they appear is not important. Example categories: Sports Baseballtags: Injury Fight Shocking If you want to apply multiple category hierarchies, use a list of names instead of a single name. If Hexo sees any categories defined this way on a post, it will treat each category for that post as its own independent hierarchy. Example categories: [Sports, Baseball] [MLB, American League, Boston Red Sox] [MLB, American League, New York Yankees] Rivalries Tag PluginsTag plugins are different from post tags. They are ported from Octopress and provide a useful way for you to quickly add specific content to your posts. Although you can write your posts in any formats, but the tag plugins will always be available and syntax remains the same. LinkInserts a link with target=”_blank” attribute. {% link text url [external] [title] %} Include CodeInserts code snippets in source/downloads/code folder. The folder location can be specified through the code_dir option in the config. {% include_code [title] [lang:language] [from:line] [to:line] path/to/file %} Include PostsInclude links to other posts. {% post_path filename %} jiesiYou can ignore permalink and folder information, like languages and dates, when using this tag. For instance: . This will work as long as the filename of the post is how-to-bake-a-cake.md, even if the post is located at source/posts/2015-02-my-family-holiday and has permalink 2018/en/how-to-bake-a-cake. You can customize the text to display, instead of displaying the post’s title. Post’s title and custom text are escaped by default. You can use the escape option to disable escaping. For instance:Display title of the post. {% post_link hexo-3-8-released %} Hexo 3.8.0 ReleasedDisplay custom text. {% post_link hexo-3-8-released 'Link to a post' %} Link to a postEscape title. {% post_link hexo-4-released 'How to use tag in title' %} RawIf certain content is causing processing issues in your posts, wrap it with the raw tag to avoid rendering errors. content Asset FoldersImageInserts an image with specified size. {% img [class names] /path/to/image [width] [height] '\"title text\" \"alt text\"' %} Embedding an image using markdownhexo-renderer-marked 3.1.0 introduced a new option that allows you to embed an image in markdown without using asset_img tag plugin. To enable: _config.ymlpost_asset_folder: truemarked: prependRoot: true postAsset: true /2020/01/02/foo/image.jpg/2020/01/02/foo.mdOnce enabled, an asset image will be automatically resolved to its corresponding post’s path. For example, “image.jpg” is located at “/2020/01/02/foo/image.jpg”, meaning it is an asset image of “/2020/01/02/foo/“ post, ![](image.jpg) will be rendered as &lt;img src=&quot;/2020/01/02/foo/image.jpg&quot;&gt;. embed image“foo.jpg” is located at http://example.com/2020/01/02/hello/foo.jpg. Default (no option) {% asset_img foo.jpg %} &lt;img src=&quot;/2020/01/02/hello/foo.jpg&quot;&gt; Global Asset FolderGlobal Asset FolderAssets are non-post files in the source folder, such as images, CSS or JavaScript files. For instance, If you are only going to have a few images in the Hexo project, then the easiest way is to keep them in a source/images directory. Then, you can access them using something like ![](/images/image.jpg). for vscode edit the md file as open the source directory as project file dont use Post Asset FolderFor users who expect to regularly serve images and/or other assets, and for those who prefer to separate their assets on a post-per-post basis, Hexo also provides a more organized way to manage assets. This slightly more involved, but very convenient approach to asset management can be turned on by setting the post_asset_folder setting in _config.yml to true. _config.ymlpost_asset_folder: true With asset folder management enabled, Hexo will create a folder every time you make a new post with the hexo new [layout] &lt;title&gt; command. This asset folder will have the same name as the markdown file associated with the post. Place all assets related to your post into the associated folder, and you will be able to reference them using a relative path, making for an easier and more convenient workflow. dont use this methodRelative Image PathThe build-in way to include images in your posts works fine, but it is a little aside the normal way to declare images in Markdown. The plugin [Hexo Asset Link] corrects that. After installing via npm install hexo-asset-link –save you can write this: ![Test Image](hello-world/image-1.png)The best is, that VS Code’s Markdown can now show the image. hexo and vscode img path problem $ npm i -s hexo-asset-link","link":"/lucfe-hexo/0004%20Formal%20science/%E8%AE%A1%E7%AE%97%E6%9C%BA%E7%A7%91%E5%AD%A6%E6%8A%80%E6%9C%AF%20Computer%20science/Software%20notations%C2%A0and%C2%A0tools/ssg/hexo-wiki-1/"},{"title":"","text":"更改icarus主题文件使网站页面在大屏幕上显示的更宽/themes/icarus/include/style/responsive.styl修改+fullhd()如下 12345678+fullhd() .is-2-column .container max-width: $fullhd - 2 * $gap width: $fullhd - 2 * $gap .is-1-column .container max-width: $widescreen - 2 * $gap width: $widescreen - 2 * $gap","link":"/lucfe-hexo/0004%20Formal%20science/%E8%AE%A1%E7%AE%97%E6%9C%BA%E7%A7%91%E5%AD%A6%E6%8A%80%E6%9C%AF%20Computer%20science/Software%20notations%C2%A0and%C2%A0tools/ssg/hexo-icarus-theme-develop/"},{"title":"Jekyll wiki","text":"Creating a GitHub Pages site with Jekyll Creating a repository for your site 每个用户唯一的一个PAGE REPOSITORYUSERNAME.github.io网站地址默认为https://USERNAME.github.io Open Git Bash. navigate to the location where you want to store your site’s source files, replacing PARENT-FOLDER with the folder you want to contain the folder for your repository. cd PARENT-FOLDER initialize a local Git repository, replacing REPOSITORY-NAME with the name of your repository. $ git init REPOSITORY-NAME Change directories to the repository. 12$ cd REPOSITORY-NAME# Changes the working directory 5.1. chose to publish your site from the docs folder on the default branch, create and change directories to the docs folder. 123$ mkdir docs# Creates a new folder called docs$ cd docs 5.2. chose to publish your site from the gh-pages branch, create and checkout the gh-pages branch. 1234$ git checkout --orphan gh-pages# Creates a new branch, with no history or contents, called gh-pages, and switches to the gh-pages branch$ git rm -rf .# Removes the contents from your default branch from the working directory To create a new Jekyll site, use the jekyll new command: $ jekyll new –skip-bundle .

The liquid tag can be used to include the partial in _includes/file.ext. _layouts These are the templates that wrap posts. Layouts are chosen on a post-by-post basis in the front matter, which is described in the next section. The liquid tag {{ content }} is used to inject content into the web page. _posts Your dynamic content, so to speak. The naming convention of these files is important, and must follow the format: YEAR-MONTH-DAY-title.MARKUP. The permalinks can be customized for each post, but the date and markup language are determined solely by the file name. _site This is where the generated site will be placed (by default) once Jekyll is done transforming it. It’s probably a good idea to add this to your .gitignore file. index.html or index.md and other HTML, Markdown files Provided that the file has a front matter section, it will be transformed by Jekyll. The same will happen for any .html, .markdown, .md, or .textile file in your site’s root directory or directories not listed above. The Gemfile and Gemfile.lock files are used by Bundler to keep track of the required gems and gem versions you need to build your Jekyll site. AssetsAny file in /assets will be copied over to the user’s site upon build unless they have a file with the same relative path. You can ship any kind of asset here: SCSS, an image, a webfont, etc. All files in /assets will be output into the compiled site in the /assets folder just as you’d expect from using Jekyll on your sites. themeTo locate a theme’s files on your computer: Run bundle info –path followed by the name of the theme’s gem, e.g., bundle info –path minima for Jekyll’s default theme. This returns the location of the gem-based theme files. CustomizationTo override the default structure and style of minima, simply create the concerned directory at the root of your site, copy the file you wish to customize to that directory, and then edit the file.e.g., to override the _includes/head.html file to specify a custom style path, create an _includes directory, copy _includes/head.html from minima gem folder to &lt;yoursite&gt;/_includes and start editing that file. To modify any stylesheet you must take the extra step of also copying the main sass file (_sass/minima.scss in the Minima theme) into the _sass directory in your site’s source. An alternative, to continue getting theme updates on all stylesheets, is to use higher specificity CSS selectors in your own additional, originally named CSS files. Converting gem-based themes to regular themesPermalinkSuppose you want to get rid of the gem-based theme and convert it to a regular theme, where all files are present in your Jekyll site directory, with nothing stored in the theme gem. To do this, copy the files from the theme gem’s directory into your Jekyll site directory. (For example, copy them to /myblog if you created your Jekyll site at /myblog. See the previous section for details.) Then you must tell Jekyll about the plugins that were referenced by the theme. You can find these plugins in the theme’s gemspec file as runtime dependencies. If you were converting the Minima theme, for example, you might see: spec.add_runtime_dependency “jekyll-feed”, “&gt; 0.12”spec.add_runtime_dependency “jekyll-seo-tag”, “&gt; 2.6” You should include these references in the Gemfile. You could list them individually in both Gemfile and _config.yml. 1234# ./Gemfilegem &quot;jekyll-feed&quot;, &quot;~&gt; 0.12&quot;gem &quot;jekyll-seo-tag&quot;, &quot;~&gt; 2.6&quot; 123456# ./_config.ymlplugins: - jekyll-feed - jekyll-seo-tag If you’re publishing on GitHub Pages you should update only your _config.yml as GitHub Pages doesn’t load plugins via Bundler. Either way, don’t forget to bundle update. Finally, remove references to the theme gem in Gemfile and configuration. For example, to remove minima: Open Gemfile and remove gem “minima”, “~&gt; 2.5”.Open _config.yml and remove theme: minima.Now bundle update will no longer get updates for the theme gem.","link":"/lucfe-hexo/0004%20Formal%20science/%E8%AE%A1%E7%AE%97%E6%9C%BA%E7%A7%91%E5%AD%A6%E6%8A%80%E6%9C%AF%20Computer%20science/Software%20notations%C2%A0and%C2%A0tools/ssg/jekyll-wiki/"},{"title":"","text":"VMWare window server修改密码VMWare——window server 2008/2012 administrator 密码忘记，设置重置密码用VMWare安装window server 2008或者2012忘记密码后，想要修改密码满麻烦的。 以下过程是我成功修改密码的过程： 1.首先需要需要链接一个ISO文件 需要特别注意把“启用连接”勾上，这个地方坑了我好长时间。不勾上，系统启动没办法CD-ROM Drive进入的。 2.关闭虚拟机。以下面的方式打开虚拟机： 3进入BIOS界面—&gt;选择Boot:确保启动方式是以CD-ROM Driver 4.然后重新启动。重新启动后，会进入到安装系统界面。 5.点击下一步，在下一个界面左下面，第一行：Repair your computer（修复你的计算机），点击这个； 6.之后会进入到选择界面，选择Troubleshoot（故障排除）： 7.之后新的界面Advanced options（高级选项）,选择Command Prompt（命令提示）选项： 8.这个时候会出现一个命令提示框，需要输入以下命令： d:（注：根据实际情况，系统盘文件放置的位置）cd windows\\system32ren Utilman.exe Utilman.exe.oldcopy cmd.exe Utilman.exe 8.关闭命令提示框，点击Continue(继续)；当出现欢迎界面，点击Windows key +U： 9.出现命令，输入以下命令：net user administrator “new password”,关闭提示框，这个时候就可以使用你新设的密码登录了。 以上步骤成功修改了vmware虚拟机window server 2008/2012的密码。","link":"/lucfe-hexo/0004%20Formal%20science/%E8%AE%A1%E7%AE%97%E6%9C%BA%E7%A7%91%E5%AD%A6%E6%8A%80%E6%9C%AF%20Computer%20science/Software%20organization/Virtual%20machine/VMWare%20window%20server%E4%BF%AE%E6%94%B9%E5%AF%86%E7%A0%81/"},{"title":"static site generator wiki","text":"ssgDocsify Docsify generates your documentation website on the fly.

在使用VMware Workstation(以下简称：VMware)创建虚拟机的过程中，配置虚拟机的网络连接是非常重要的一环，当我们为虚拟机配置网络连接时，我们可以看到如下图所示的几种网络连接模式：桥接模式、NAT模式、仅主机模式、自定义网络连接模式。那么这几种网络连接模式都各自有什么主要用途，它们之间又有哪些区别呢？ 磨刀不误砍柴工，为了更好地使用虚拟机，了解这几种连接模式的主要用途以及它们之间的区别是非常有必要的。在这里，我们就以下面的网络连接示意图为例来进行相关介绍。 在VMware中，虚拟机的网络连接主要是由VMware创建的虚拟交换机(也叫做虚拟网络)负责实现的，VMware可以根据需要创建多个虚拟网络。在Windows系统的主机上，VMware最多可以创建20个虚拟网络，每个虚拟网络可以连接任意数量的虚拟机网络设备； 在Linux系统的主机上，VMware最多可以创建255个虚拟网络，但每个虚拟网络仅能连接32个虚拟机网络设备。VMware的虚拟网络都是以”VMnet+数字”的形式来命名的，例如 VMnet0、VMnet1、VMnet2……以此类推(在Linux系统的主机上，虚拟网络的名称均采用小写形式，例如 vmnet0 )。 当我们安装VMware时，VMware会自动为3种网络连接模式各自创建1个虚拟机网络：VMnet0(桥接模式)、VMnet8(NAT模式)、VMnet1(仅主机模式)。此外，我们也可以根据需要自行创建更多的虚拟网络。 VMware 桥接模式 VMware桥接模式，也就是将虚拟机的虚拟网络适配器与主机的物理网络适配器进行交接，虚拟机中的虚拟网络适配器可通过主机中的物理网络适配器直接访问到外部网络(例如图中所示的局域网和Internet，下同)。简而言之，这就好像在上图所示的局域网中添加了一台新的、独立的计算机一样。因此，虚拟机也会占用局域网中的一个IP地址，并且可以和其他终端进行相互访问。桥接模式网络连接支持有线和无线主机网络适配器。如果你想把虚拟机当做一台完全独立的计算机看待，并且允许它和其他终端一样的进行网络通信，那么桥接模式通常是虚拟机访问网络的最简单途径。 VMware NAT模式 NAT，是Network Address Translation的缩写，意即网络地址转换。NAT模式也是VMware创建虚拟机的默认网络连接模式。使用NAT模式网络连接时，VMware会在主机上建立单独的专用网络，用以在主机和虚拟机之间相互通信。虚拟机向外部网络发送的请求数据”包裹”，都会交由NAT网络适配器加上”特殊标记”并以主机的名义转发出去，外部网络返回的响应数据”包裹”，也是先由主机接收，然后交由NAT网络适配器根据”特殊标记”进行识别并转发给对应的虚拟机，因此，虚拟机在外部网络中不必具有自己的IP地址。从外部网络来看，虚拟机和主机在共享一个IP地址，默认情况下，外部网络终端也无法访问到虚拟机。 此外，在一台主机上只允许有一个NAT模式的虚拟网络。因此，同一台主机上的多个采用NAT模式网络连接的虚拟机也是可以相互访问的。 前面我们已经提到，默认情况下，外部网络无法访问到虚拟机，不过我们也可以通过手动修改NAT设置实现端口转发功能，将外部网络发送到主机指定端口的数据转发到指定的虚拟机上。比如，我们在虚拟机的80端口上”建立”了一个站点，只要我们设置端口转发，将主机88端口上的数据转发给虚拟机的80端口，就可以让外部网络通过主机的88端口访问到虚拟机80端口上的站点。 VMware 仅主机模式 仅主机模式，是一种比NAT模式更加封闭的的网络连接模式，它将创建完全包含在主机中的专用网络。仅主机模式的虚拟网络适配器仅对主机可见，并在虚拟机和主机系统之间提供网络连接。相对于NAT模式而言，仅主机模式不具备NAT功能，因此在默认情况下，使用仅主机模式网络连接的虚拟机无法连接到Internet(在主机上安装合适的路由或代理软件，或者在Windows系统的主机上使用Internet连接共享功能，仍然可以让虚拟机连接到Internet或其他网络)。 在同一台主机上可以创建多个仅主机模式的虚拟网络，如果多个虚拟机处于同一个仅主机模式网络中，那么它们之间是可以相互通信的；如果它们处于不同的仅主机模式网络，则默认情况下无法进行相互通信(可通过在它们之间设置路由器来实现相互通信)。 自定义网络连接配置 利用 WMware 提供的虚拟网络连接组件，你还可以创建复杂的虚拟网络。在这里我们不对其进行详细介绍，你可以参考官方文档，然后通过VMware提供的虚拟网络编辑器来创建虚拟网络。 形象的说： 桥接模式的虚拟机，就像一个在路由器”民政局”那里”上过户口”的成年人，有自己单独的居住地址，虽然和主机住在同一个大院里，但好歹是有户口的人，可以大摇大摆地直接和外面通信。 NAT模式的虚拟机，纯粹就是一个没上过户口的黑户，路由器”民政局”根本不知道有这么个人，自然也不会主动和它通信。即使虚拟机偶尔要向外面发送点的信件，都得交给主机以主机的名义转发出去，主机还专门请了一位叫做NAT的老大爷来专门负责这些虚拟机的发信、收信事宜。仅主机模式的虚拟机，纯粹是一个彻彻底底的黑奴，不仅没有户口、路由器”民政局”不知道这么号人，还被主机关在小黑屋里，连信件也不准往外发。","link":"/lucfe-hexo/0004%20Formal%20science/%E8%AE%A1%E7%AE%97%E6%9C%BA%E7%A7%91%E5%AD%A6%E6%8A%80%E6%9C%AF%20Computer%20science/Software%20organization/Virtual%20machine/VMware%E7%BD%91%E7%BB%9C%E8%BF%9E%E6%8E%A5%E6%A8%A1%E5%BC%8F/"},{"title":"","text":"Ubuntu

Appache,PHP and MySQL on ubuntuIn this tutorial we are going to learn how to configure Ubuntu 18.04 server as a web server using the Ubuntu LAMP stack, which includes the Apache web server, PHP programming Language and MySQL/MariaDB Database Server. We will start by installing and configuring Apache web server, then we will install PHP, MySQL Server and phpMyAdmin web interface. Install and Configure Apache web server on Ubuntu 18.04Apache is the most popular and stable web server for Ubuntu Linux. The Apache HTTP server for Ubuntu 18 provided by the apache2 package. To install apache2 on Ubuntu, open the terminal and execute: 12sudo apt-get updatesudo apt-get install apache2 That is all you need to do. Now, open a web browser from a remote computer and type the IP address of your Ubuntu server in the address bar. You will get the Apache2 Ubuntu Default Page. Install and Configure Apache web server on Ubuntu 18.04The apache2.conf file is the main configuration file which you can find under the /etc/apache2/ directory.The /var/www/html is the default DocumentRoot, You can immediately serve static HTML website by putting the contents (e.g. HTML, images, CSS, JavaScript and etc.) into the /var/www/html directory.Creating Apache Virtual HostsVirtual Hosting are a way of serving multiple websites from a single server. Every website will have their own configuration and separate Document Root to host website contents. Creating an Apache Virtual Host is a simple task. For this demonstration, I am going to create a new virtual host for the example.com domain. The /var/www/example.com directory going to be the DocumentRoot. First create the DocumentRoot: sudo mkdir /var/www/example.com Create the Virtual Host configuration file inside the /etc/apache2/sites-available/ folder (Filename must end with ‘.conf’ extension). sudo vim /etc/apache2/sites-available/example.com.conf Add following VirtualHost configuration: 1234567&lt;VirtualHost *:80&gt; ServerName www.example.com ServerAlias example.com DocumentRoot /var/www/example.com ErrorLog ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/error.log CustomLog ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/access.log combined&lt;/VirtualHost&gt; Save the file, enable the new site and reload the Apache web server: sudo a2ensite example.com.confsudo systemctl reload apache2And now our web server is ready to serve &lt;www.example.com&gt; website. Of Course we still don’t have anything in our DocumentRoot and you also need to configure DNS records to point your domain name to the server IP address. To test virtual host without DNS, create an index.html file inside the DocumentRoot and entry to the hosts file on your local computer, pointing &lt;www.example.com&gt; to your Ubuntu server IP address. Install PHP programming LanguagePHP is a programming language for developing web applications and essential part of the Ubuntu LAMP Stack. To install PHP on Ubuntu 18.04, Run: sudo apt-get updatesudo apt-get install php The php package will install the “php7.2” as well as “libapache2-mod-php7.2” module that required to work with Ubuntu Apache web server. After the installation is complete, we need to restart the apache server: sudo systemctl restart apache2.serviceTo test the PHP installation, create an index.php file under the /var/www/html folder and add the phpinfo() function: 123&lt;?php phpinfo();?&gt; Then access the index.php by typing http://your-server-ip/index.php in the web browser (e.g. 192.168.1.100/index.php). You should get information page that displays PHP configuration settings on your Ubuntu 18.04 Server. Install MySQL Server on Ubuntu 18.04Next, we are going to install MySQL Server as our Database server. Installing MySQL Server on Ubuntu 18.04 is straightforward. Open the terminal update the package list and install the mysql-server package: sudo apt-get install mysql-server(If you want to Install MariaDB, install the mariadb-server package instead of mysql-server package). After the installation has finished, Log in to the MySQL console with the following command: sudo mysqlNote that the MySQL server on Ubuntu use auth_socket plugin to authenticate mysql root and does not need a password for connecting as a root user. If you want to enable password authentication, click on the following link to learn how to set the MySQL root password on Ubuntu 18.04. Install phpMyAdmin on Ubuntu 18.04phpMyAdmin is a web based graphical user interface to manage MySQL/MariaDB Database server. To install phpMyAdmin on Ubuntu 18.04 Server, Run: sudo apt-get updatesudo apt-get install phpmyadminWhen asked to choose web server that should be automatically configured to run phpMyAdmin, select apache2 by pressing the space bar on the keyboard. Install phpMyAdmin on Ubuntu 18.04After the installation completes, you can access phpMyAdmin at http://server-ip/phpmyadmin or http://domain-name/phpmyadmin. Now you have a fully functional web server up and running with Apache, MySQL and PHP programming language. SummaryIn this tutorial we learned how to install Lamp stack on Ubuntu 18.04 server. The LAMP stack stands for Linux Apache MySQL and PHP, it is a web hosting platform for Linux to server web pages using http protocol.","link":"/lucfe-hexo/0004%20Formal%20science/%E8%AE%A1%E7%AE%97%E6%9C%BA%E7%A7%91%E5%AD%A6%E6%8A%80%E6%9C%AF%20Computer%20science/Software%20organization/unix/intall%20Appache,PHP%20and%20MySQL%20on%20ubuntu/"},{"title":"","text":"CygwinCygwin是一个在windows平台上运行的类UNIX模拟环境，是Cygnus

LDAP 的 AD 域服务器搭建及其使用1.1 AD 域服务 什么是目录（directory）呢？ 日常生活中使用的电话薄内记录着亲朋好友的姓名、电话与地址等数据，它就是 telephone directory（电话目录）；计算机中的文件系统（file system）内记录着文件的文件名、大小与日期等数据，它就是 file directory（文件目录）。 如果这些目录内的数据能够由系统加以整理，用户就能够容易且迅速地查找到所需的数据，而 directory service（目录服务）提供的服务，就是要达到此目的。在现实生活中，查号台也是一种目录；在 Internet 上，百度和谷歌提供的搜索功能也是一种目录服务。 Active Directory 域内的 directory database（目录数据库）被用来存储用户账户、计算机账户、打印机和共享文件夹等对象，而提供目录服务的组件就是 Active Directory （活动目录）域服务（Active Directory Domain Service，AD DS），它负责目录数据库的存储、添加、删除、修改与查询等操作。一般适用于一个局域网内。 在 AD 域服务（AD DS）内，AD 就是一个命名空间（Namespace）。利用 AD，我们可以通过对象名称来找到与这个对象有关的所有信息。 在 TCP/IP 网络环境内利用 Domain Name System（DNS）来解析主机名与 IP 地址的对应关系，也就是利用 DNS 来解析来得到主机的 IP 地址。除此之外，AD 域服务也与 DNS 紧密结合在一起，它的域命名空间也是采用 DNS 架构，因此域名采用 DNS 格式来命名，例如可以将 AD 域的域名命名为 moonxy.com。 1.2 AD域对象与属性 AD 域内的资源以对象（Object）的形式存在，例如用户、计算机与打印机等都是对象，而对象则通过属性（Attriburte）来描述其特征，也就是说对象本身是一些属性的集合。例如，创建一个账户张三，则必须添加一个对象类型（object class）为用户的对象（也就是用户账户），然后在这个用户账户内输入张三的姓名、登录账户、电话号码和电子邮件等信息，这其中的用户账户就是对象，而姓名、登录账户等数据就是该对象的属性，张三就是对象类型为用户（user）的对象。 1.3 AD 域控制器 DC AD 域服务（AD DS）的目录数据存储在域控制器（Domain Controller，DC）内。一个域内可以有多台域控制器，每台域控制器的地位几乎是平等的，它们各自存储着一份几乎完全相同的 Active Directory。当在任何一台域控制器内添加了一个用户账户后，此账户默认被创建在此域控制器的 Active Directory，之后会自动被复制（replicate）到其他域控制器的 Active Directory，以便让所有域控制器内的 Active Directory 数据都能够同步（synchronize）。 当用户在域内某台计算机登录时，会由其中一台域控制器根据其 Active Directory 内的账户数据，来审核用户输入的账户与密码是否正确。如果是正确的，用户就可以登录成功；反之，会被拒绝登录。域控制器是由服务器级别的额计算机来扮演的，例如 Windows Server 2012 和 Windows Server 2008 R2 等。 通常，域控制器的 Active Directory 数据库是可以被读写的，除此之外，还有 Active Directory 数据库是只可以读取、不可以被修改的只读域控制器（Read-Only Domain Controller，RODC）。例如，某子公司位于远程网络，如果安全措施并不像总公司一样完备，则可以使用 RODC。 1.4 LDAP LDAP（Lightweight Directory Access Protocol），轻量目录访问协议，是一种用来查询与更新 Active Directory 的目录服务通信协议。AD 域服务利用 LDAP 命名路径（LDAP naming path）来表示对象在 AD 内的位置，以便用它来访问 AD 内的对象。 LDAP 数据的组织方式： LDAP 名称路径如下： 标识名称（distinguished Name，DN）：它是对象在 Active Directory 内的完整路径，DN 有三个属性，分别是 CN，OU，DC。 DC (Domain Component)：域名组件； CN (Common Name)：通用名称，一般为用户名或计算机名； OU (Organizational Unit)：组织单位； 例如，如上用户账户，其 DN 为： CN=张三,OU=Web前端组,OU=软件开发部,DC=moonxy,DC=com 其中 DC（Domain Component）表示 DNS 域名中的组件，例如 moonxy.com 中的 moonxy 与 com；OU为组织单位（Organization Unit）；CN为通用名称（Common Name），一般为用户名或服务器名。除了DC与OU之外，其他都利用CN来表示，例如用户与计算机对象都属于CN。上述DN表示法中的 moonxy.com 为域名，软件研发部、Web前端组都是组织单位。此 DN 表示账户张三存储在 moonxy.com\\软件研发部\\Web前端组路径中。 相对标识名称（Relative Distinguished Name，RDN）：RDN用来代表DN完整路径中的部分路径，例如上面路径中的 CN=张三与 OU=Web前端组等都是 RDN。 Base DN：LDAP 目录树的最顶部就是根，也就是所谓的 “Base DN”，如 “DC=moonxy,DC=com”。 除了 DN 与 RDN 这两个对象名称外，另外还有如下两个名称： 全局唯一标识符（Global Unique Identifier，GUID）：GUID 是一个128位的数值，系统会自动为每个对象指定一个唯一的GUID。虽然可以改变对象的名称，但是其GUID永远不会改变。 用户主体名称（User Principal Name，UPN）：每个用户还可以有一个比DN更短、更容易记忆的 UPN，例如上面的张三隶属于 moonxy.com，则其 UPN 可以为 zhangsan@moonxy.com。用户登录时所输入的账户名最好是 UPN，因为无论此用户的账户被移动到哪一个域，其 UPN 都不会改变，因此用户可以一直使用同一个名称来登录。 AD 与 LDAP 的关系：LDAP 是一种用来访问 AD 数据库的目录服务协议，AD DS 会通过 LDAP 名称路径来表示对象在 AD 数据库中的位置，以便用它来访问 AD 数据库内的对象。LDAP 的名称路径包括有 DN、RDN。 openLDAP（Linux），Active Directory（Microsoft）等是对 LDAP 目录访问协议的具体实现，除了实现协议的功能，还对它进行了扩展。 1.5 全局编录 虽然在域树内的所有域共享一个 Active Directory，但是 Active Directory 数据却分散在各个域内，而每个域仅存储该域本身的数据。因此，为了让用户、应用程序能够快速找到位于其他域内的资源，在 AD 域服务器内设计了全局编录（Global Catalog，GC）。 全局编录的数据存储在域控制器内，这台域控制器被称为全局编录服务器，它存储着林内所有域的 AD 内的每个对象。不过只存储对象的部分属性，这些属性都是常用来搜索的属性，例如用户的电话号码、登录账户名等。全局编录让用户即使不知道对象位于哪一个域内，仍然可以快速的找到所需的对象。 用户登录时，全局编录服务器还负责提供该用户所属的通用组的信息；用户利用 UPN 登录时，它会负责提供该用户隶属于哪一个域的信息。 一个林内的所有域树共享相同的全局编录，而林内的第一台域控制器默认就是全局编录服务器。必要时，也可以另外指派其他域控制器来当做全局编录服务器。","link":"/lucfe-hexo/0004%20Formal%20science/%E8%AE%A1%E7%AE%97%E6%9C%BA%E7%A7%91%E5%AD%A6%E6%8A%80%E6%9C%AF%20Computer%20science/Software%20organization/windows%20operation%20system.md/windows%20server/"},{"title":"","text":"windows

方法1：借用VBS脚本 1%1 mshta vbscript:CreateObject(&quot;Shell.Application&quot;).ShellExecute(&quot;cmd.exe&quot;,&quot;/c %~s0 ::&quot;,&quot;&quot;,&quot;runas&quot;,1)(window.close)&amp;&amp;exit 方法2：借用VBS脚本 12%1 start &quot;&quot; mshta vbscript:createobject(&quot;shell.application&quot;).shellexecute(&quot;&quot;&quot;%~0&quot;&quot;&quot;,&quot;::&quot;,,&quot;runas&quot;,1)(window.close)&amp;exitexit /B 方法3：借用VBS脚本 12345echo Set UAC = CreateObject^(&quot;Shell.Application&quot;^) &gt; &quot;%temp%\\getadmin.vbs&quot;echo UAC.ShellExecute &quot;%~s0&quot;, &quot;&quot;, &quot;&quot;, &quot;runas&quot;, 1 &gt;&gt; &quot;%temp%\\getadmin.vbs&quot;&quot;%temp%\\getadmin.vbs&quot;del /f /q &quot;%temp%\\getadmin.vbs&quot; &gt;nulexit /B 方法4：借用第三方程序 12nircmd elevate cmd /c &quot;%0&quot;exit /B 方法5：runas命令runas /noprofile /user:Administrator “%0”exit /B 以上是批处理获取管理员权限的5种方法，只要把这几个命令放进批处理优先执行即可，当然还要加上判断是否已经获取管理员权限的语句，否则批处理就会无限循环下去。判断批处理是否已获取管理员权限的方法，网上用的最多的是下面这句命令： 以方法1为例： 123456&gt;nul 2&gt;&amp;1 &quot;%SYSTEMROOT%\\system32\\cacls.exe&quot; &quot;%SYSTEMROOT%\\system32\\config\\system&quot;if '%errorlevel%' NEQ '0' (goto UACPrompt) else (goto UACAdmin):UACPrompt%1 mshta vbscript:CreateObject(&quot;Shell.Application&quot;).ShellExecute(&quot;cmd.exe&quot;,&quot;/c %~s0 ::&quot;,&quot;&quot;,&quot;runas&quot;,1)(window.close)&amp;&amp;exit:UACAdminecho 已获取管理员权限 用cacls命令来判断管理员权限固然不错，但经过实践我发现cacls返回的errorlevel值不够稳定，经常会变换出其他不可预知的错误码，造成判断有误，导致批处理进入死循环。当然也有人采用能否往系统目录（比如system32）写入文件的方法来判断，我觉得这些都不够好，后来我发现使用bcdedit命令来判断比较准确，一般情况下它只会返回两个错误码0和1，很少见到有其他值出现，目前它是我觉得用来判断管理员权限最好的方法。 前3种方法是使用了VBS脚本，方法1最简洁，一行代码就搞定了，但我发现Win10系统似乎不支持短文件名，一旦文件路径出现空格，该命令就会出错；方法2也不赖，只有两行代码，在Win10系统能稳定运行；方法3比较复杂，还会产生临时文件，但也能在Win10系统稳定运行；第4种方法使用了第三方程序，不会产生临时文件，代码也简单，但你得先下载nircmd.exe这个工具；第5种方法采用了系统自带的命令runas来实现，理论上是没问题的，但实际上比较难实现，首先要求Administrator管理员账户必须已经启用，其次还必须设置有管理员密码，否则都会得到拒绝的提示。 以上5种方法都可以提升批处理的运行权限，可根据具体情况选择最合适的方法，我比较喜欢方法2，代码简洁，运行稳定，不会产生临时文件，其次方法4也不错。如果您有更好的批处理提权方法，也可以跟大家一起分享！共同进步！ 附：批处理获取管理员权限完整代码 123456789101112@echo offif exist &quot;%SystemRoot%\\SysWOW64&quot; path
