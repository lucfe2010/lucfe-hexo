## 1.1. diet

A healthy diet provides the body with essential nutrition: fluid, macronutrients such as protein, micronutrients such as vitamins, and adequate(enough in quantity, or good enough in quality, for a particular purpose or need) fibre and food energy.

A healthy diet may contain fruits, vegetables, and whole grains, and may include little to no processed food or sweetened beverages. The requirements for a healthy diet can be met from a variety of plant-based and animal-based foods

> A whole grain is a grain of any cereal and pseudocereal that contains the endosperm, germ, and bran, in contrast to refined grains, which retain only the endosperm.全谷物是指任何含有胚乳、胚芽和麸皮的谷物和伪谷物，而精制谷物只保留胚乳。

### 1.1.1. The seven major classes of nutrients

Essential nutrients cannot be synthesized in the organism in sufficient quantities for survival, and therefore must be obtained through the diet.

#### 1.1.1.1. carbohydrates

Carbohydrates may be classified as monosaccharides, disaccharides or polysaccharides depending on the number of monomer (sugar) units they contain. They are a diverse group of substances, with a range of chemical, physical and physiological properties. They make up a large part of foods such as rice, noodles, bread, and other grain-based products

Monosaccharides contain one sugar unit, disaccharides two, and polysaccharides three or more.

#### 1.1.1.2. fat

Different foods contain different amounts of fat with different proportions of saturated and unsaturated fatty acids.

Some animal products, like beef and dairy products made with whole or reduced fat milk like yogurt, ice cream, cheese and butter have mostly saturated fatty acids (and some have significant contents of dietary cholesterol).

Other animal products, like pork, poultry, eggs, and seafood have mostly unsaturated fats.

Plants and fish oil generally contain a higher proportion of unsaturated acids, although there are exceptions such as coconut oil and palm kernel oil.

Many careful studies have found that replacing saturated fats with cis unsaturated fats in the diet reduces risk of cardiovascular diseases (CVDs), diabetes, or death. These studies prompted many medical organizations and public health departments, including the World Health Organization (WHO), to officially issue that advice.

#### 1.1.1.3. fiber

Dietary fiber (in Commonwealth English fibre) or roughage is the portion of plant-derived food that cannot be completely broken down by human digestive enzymes.

Dietary fiber is a carbohydrate, specifically a polysaccharide, which is incompletely absorbed in humans and in some animals.

Like all carbohydrates, when it is metabolized, it can produce four Calories (kilocalories) of energy per gram, but in most circumstances, it accounts for less than that because of its limited absorption and digestibility.

#### 1.1.1.4. minerals

Dietary minerals are inorganic chemical elements required by living organisms, other than the four elements carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, and oxygen that are present in nearly all organic molecules.

1. Macrominerals

   Elements with recommended dietary allowance (RDA) greater than 150 mg/day are

2. Trace minerals

   Many elements are required in smaller amounts (microgram quantities), usually because they play a catalytic role in enzymes. Some trace mineral elements (RDA < 200 mg/day) are

3. Ultratrace minerals

   Ultratrace minerals are an as yet unproven aspect of human nutrition, and may be required at amounts measured in very low ranges of μg/day.

#### 1.1.1.5. proteins

Proteins are essential nutrients for the human body. They are one of the building blocks of body tissue and can also serve as a fuel source.

The most important aspect and defining characteristic of protein from a nutritional standpoint is its amino acid(氨基酸) composition.

During human digestion, proteins are broken down in the stomach to smaller polypeptide chains via hydrochloric acid and protease actions. This is crucial for the absorption of the essential amino acids that cannot be biosynthesized by the body.

There are nine essential amino acids which humans must obtain from their diet in order to prevent protein-energy malnutrition and resulting death. They are phenylalanine, valine, threonine, tryptophan, methionine, leucine, isoleucine, lysine, and histidine.

#### 1.1.1.6. vitamins

Vitamins are organic molecules (or a set of closely related molecules called vitamers) that are essential to an organism in small quantities for proper metabolic(代谢 the chemical processes in living things that change food, etc. into energy and materials for growth) function.

Except for vitamin D, vitamins are essential nutrients, necessary in the diet for good health.

Vitamin D can be synthesized in the skin in the presence of UVB radiation.

#### 1.1.1.7. water

Water is excreted from the body in multiple forms; including urine and feces, sweating, and by water vapour in the exhaled breath. Therefore, it is necessary to adequately rehydrate to replace lost fluids.

### 1.1.2. World Health Organization Recommendations

The World Health Organization (WHO) makes the following five recommendations with respect to both populations and individuals:

1. Maintain a healthy weight by eating roughly the same number of calories that your body is using.
2. Limit intake of fats to no more than 30% of total caloric intake, preferring unsaturated fats to saturated(饱和) fats. Avoid trans(反式) fats.
3. Eat at least 400 grams of fruits and vegetables per day (not counting potatoes, sweet potatoes(红薯), cassava(木薯), and other starchy roots(淀粉根)). A healthy diet also contains legumes (e.g. lentils(扁豆), beans), whole grains, and nuts.
4. Limit the intake of simple sugars to less than 10% of caloric intake (below 5% of calories or 25 grams may be even better).
5. Limit salt/sodium(钠) from all sources and ensure that salt is iodized(加碘). Less than 5 grams of salt per day can reduce the risk of cardiovascular(心血管) disease.

The WHO has stated that insufficient vegetables and fruit is the cause of 2.8% of deaths worldwide.

Other WHO recommendations include:

- ensuring that the foods chosen have sufficient vitamins and certain minerals;
- avoiding directly poisonous (e.g. heavy metals) and carcinogenic(致癌) (e.g. benzene 苯) substances;
- avoiding foods contaminated by human pathogens (e.g. E. coli 大肠杆菌, tapeworm eggs 绦虫卵);
- and replacing saturated fats with polyunsaturated fats in the diet, which can reduce the risk of coronary artery(Coronary means belonging or relating to the heart.冠状动脉) disease and diabetes(糖尿病).

### 1.1.3. 中国居民膳食指南

膳食指南 是以食物为基础、以营养科学为依据的一组原则性建议和群众宣传教育手段。它的目的在于指导大众合理用餐以改善营养，预防与膳食有关的疾病，增进人群的健康。膳食指南是在长期社会实践的过程中发展起来的。

1. 膳食指南的内容

   1. 食物多样、谷物为主。各种食物所含营养成分不同，没有一种食物能供给人体所需的全部营养素，所以每日膳食必须由多种多样的食物适当搭配，以满足人体对多种经营素的需要。

   2. 多吃蔬菜、水果和薯类。蔬菜水果和薯类都含有较丰富的维生素、矿物质及膳食纤维等营养素，对保护心血管健康，增强抗病力和预防某些癌症有重要作用。

   3. 常吃奶类、豆类或其制品。经常吃奶类可以提高儿童、青少年的骨密度，减缓老年人骨质疏松症。豆类营养丰富，含优质蛋白、不饱和脂肪酸、钙及 B 族维生素等多种营养物质，既可改善膳食营养素供给，又可避免吃肉类过多的不利影响。

   4. 经常吃适量鱼、禽、蛋、瘦肉，少吃肥肉和荤油。鱼、禽、蛋及瘦肉是优质蛋白、脂溶性维生素和某些矿物质的重要来源。

   5. 食量与体力活动要平衡，保持适当的体重。

   6. 吃清淡少盐的膳食。食品不应太油腻、太咸，少吃油炸、烟熏食物。每人每日食盐用量以不超过 6 克为宜；少吃咸菜、味精等含钠的食物；吃盐多会增加高血压的危险。

   7. 饮酒应限量。白酒除具有能量外，不含有其他的营养素。

   8. 吃清洁、卫生、不变质的食物。

2. 平衡膳食宝塔

   中国居民平衡膳食宝塔是根据中国居民膳食指南，结合中国居民的膳食，把平衡膳食的原则转化成各类食物的重量，便于大家在日常生活中实行。

   1. 平衡膳食宝塔共分五层，包含我们每天应吃的主要食物种类。宝塔各层位置和面积不同，这在一定程度上反映出各类食物在膳食中的地位和应占的比重。谷类食物位居底层，每人每天应该吃 300-500 克；蔬菜和水果占据第二层，每天应吃 400-500 克和 100-200 克；鱼、禽、肉、蛋等动物性食物位于第三层，每天应该吃 125-200 克（鱼虾类 50 克，畜、禽肉 50-100 克，蛋类 25-50 克）；奶类和豆类食物合占第四层，每天应该吃奶类及奶制品 100 克和豆类及豆制品 50 克。第五层塔尖是油脂类，每天不超过 25 克。

      宝塔没有建议食糖的摄入量。因为我国居民现在平均吃食糖的量还不多，少吃些或适当多吃些可能对健康的影响不大。但多吃糖有增加龋齿的危险，尤其是儿童、青少年不应吃太多的糖和含糖食品。

   2. 宝塔建议的各类食物的摄入量一般是指食物的生重。各类食物的组成是根据全国营养调查中居民膳食的实际情况计算的，所以每一类食物中毒的重量不是指某一种具体食物的重量。

      1. 谷类：是指面粉、大米、玉米粉、小麦、高粱等的总和。它们是膳食中能量的主要来源。

      2. 蔬菜和水果：蔬菜和水果经常放在一起，因为它们有许多共性。但蔬菜和水果终究是两类食物，各有优势，不能完全彼此替代。

      3. 鱼肉蛋：鱼、肉、蛋归为一类，主要提供动物性蛋白质和一些重要的无机盐和维生素。但它们彼此间也有明显区别。

      4. 奶类和豆类食物：宝塔建议的 100 克是按蛋白质和钙的含量来折算的，约相当于鲜奶 200 克或奶粉 28 克。中国居民膳食中普遍缺钙，奶类应是首选补钙食物，很难用其他类食物代替。

## 1.2. exercise

Exercise is a body activity that enhances or maintains physical fitness and overall health and wellness

Aerobic exercise is any physical activity that uses large muscle groups and causes the body to use more oxygen than it would while resting. The goal of aerobic exercise is to increase cardiovascular(心血管的 connected with the heart and the blood vessels) endurance.

Examples of aerobic exercise include running, cycling, swimming, brisk walking, skipping rope, rowing, hiking, dancing, playing tennis, continuous training, and long distance running.

Anaerobic exercise is a type of exercise that breaks down glucose in the body without using oxygen; anaerobic means "without oxygen".Anaerobic exercise, which includes strength and resistance training, can firm, strengthen, and increase muscle mass, as well as improve bone density, balance, and coordination.

Flexibility exercises stretch and lengthen muscles.

## 1.3. sleep

Adults (18–64 years) 7 to 9 hours

## 1.4. self care

Self-care has been defined as the process of establishing behaviors to ensure holistic well-being of oneself, to promote health, and actively manage illness when it occurs.

Individuals engage in some form of self-care daily with food choices, exercise, sleep, reading and dental care.
