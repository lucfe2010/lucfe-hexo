        - data or information flow within an information system

          - from its origin through processing, storage, and output

      - automated design tool

        - CASE: computer-aided software engineering

  - documenting system analysis

- phase 3: system design: design a new or alternative information system

  - design alternative system

    - evaluate feasibility(可行性)

      - economic

        - cost
        - benifits

      - technical

        - available of reliable hardware, software, and training

      - operational

        - will people--employees, managers, clients--resist it?

  - selecting the best system

    - fit in with organization's overall information system
    - flexible enough so it can be modified in the future
    - made secure against unauthorized use
    - benefits worth the costs

  - writing the system design report

    - concludes by recommending one of the alternatives

- phase 4: system development:  new software and hardware are acquired, developed, and tested

  - acquiring software

    - purchased as off-the-shelf(货架上的，现成的) packaged software and possibly modified, or custom designed

      - data collection and  cleaning
      - initial data import

    - new development

  - acquiring hardware

    - computer equipment and places
    - sufficient as a company grows or expandable

  - testing the new system

    - sample data
    - revised(修订) as necessary

- phase 5: system implementation(convertion): new information system is installed, and people are trained to use it

  - types

    - direct approach

      - run old and new side by side

        - expensive

    - parallel approach

      - abandon the old

        - risky

    - pilot approach

      - tried out in only one part of the organization
      - many people perform similar operations

    - phased approach

      - gradually over a periiod of time
      - many people perform different operations

  - training

    - don't overlook(忽视)

      - key terms
      - function useage

        - notes

      - common problems

- phase 6: system maintenance: the system is periodically evaluated and updated as needed

  - system audit

    - performance is compared to the original design specification
    - modified or redesign

  - periodic evaluation

    - evaluate from time to time
