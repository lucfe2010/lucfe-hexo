> Use the Find All References (Shift+Alt+F12) command to find all locations in the current workspace where a Markdown header or link is referenced:

### 1.2.1. asdfs asdf

> Tired of accidentally breaking links when you change a Markdown header? Try using Rename Symbol (F2) instead. After you type the new header name and press Enter, VS Code will update the header as well as automatically updating all links to that header:

### 1.2.2. adsff

Code blocks are normally indented four spaces or one tab. When they’re in a list, indent them eight spaces or two tabs.

    <html>
      <head>
        <title>Test</title>
      </head>

> To denote a word or phrase as code, enclose it in backticks (`).

At the command prompt, type `nano wesfdal sdaf asdf fas`.

### Fenced Code Blocks

    ```json
    {
      "firstName": "John",
      "lastName": "Smith",
      "age": 25
    }
    ```

    > To fix violations of this rule, use a consistent style (either indenting or code fences).

    ```json
    {
      "firstName": "John",
      "lastName": "Smith",
      "age": 25
    }
    ```

## 1.5. 列表

> Unless the paragraph is in a list, don’t indent paragraphs with spaces or tabs.
>
> To add another element in a list while preserving the continuity of the list, indent the element four spaces or one tab, as shown in the following examples.

1. asdf

> Path completions
> Path completions help with create links to files and images. These paths are shown automatically by IntelliSense as you type the path of an image or link, and can also be manually requested by using Ctrl+Space.
> Paths starting with / are resolved relative to the current workspace root, while paths staring with ./ or without any prefix are resolved relative to the current file. Path suggestions are automatically shown when you type / or can be manually invoked by using Ctrl+Space.

> To add a link to an image, enclose the Markdown for the image in brackets, and then add the link in parentheses.

> If you prefer using the keyboard, you can also Copy and paste a file or image data into a Markdown editor.

> With automatic Markdown link updating, VS Code will automatically update Markdown links whenever a linked to file is moved or renamed. You can enable this feature with the markdown.updateLinksOnFileMove.enabled setting.

> Path IntelliSense can also help you link to headers within the current file or within another Markdown file. Start the path with # to see completions for all the headers in the file (depending on your settings, you may need to use Ctrl+Space to see these):

[asdf](#13-段落文本-asdf)

> Accept one of these completions to insert the full link to that header, even if it's in another file:

### Reference-style Links

tishi [hobbit-hole][1]

[1]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hobbit#Lifestyle "Hobbit lifestyles"

In a hole in the ground there lived a hobbit. Not a nasty, dirty, wet hole, filled with the ends
of worms and an oozy smell, nor yet a dry, bare, sandy hole with nothing in it to sit down on or to
eat: it was a [hobbit-hole][2], and that means comfort.

### Footnotes

Here's a simple footnote,[^1] and here's a longer one.[^bignote]

[^1]: This is the first footnote.
[^bignote]: Here's one with multiple paragraphs and code.

    Indent paragraphs to include them in the footnote.

    `{ my code }`

    Add as many paragraphs as you like.
