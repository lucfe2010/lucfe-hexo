## Motherboard 主板

### Form factor

Form factor is a hardware design aspect that defines and prescribes the size, shape, and other physical specifications of components, particularly in electronics

ATX (Advanced Technology Extended) is a motherboard and power supply configuration specification, patented by David Dent in 1995 at Intel

It was the first major change in desktop computer enclosure, motherboard and power supply design in many years, improving standardization and interchangeability of parts.

The specification defines the dimensions; the mounting points; the I/O panel; and the power and connector interfaces among a computer case, a motherboard, and a power supply.

ATX（Advanced Technology Extended）主板规格由英特尔公司在1995年制定。

#### ATX connectors

ATX allowed each motherboard manufacturer to put these ports in a rectangular area on the back of the system with an arrangement they could define themselves, though a number of general patterns depending on what ports the motherboard offers have been followed by most manufacturers.

 Cases are usually fitted with a snap-out panel, also known as an I/O plate or I/O shield, in one of the common arrangements.
 I/O plates are usually included with retail motherboards to allow installation in any suitable case.

The computer will operate correctly without a plate fitted, although there will be open gaps in the case which may compromise the EMI/RFI screening and allow ingress of dirt and random foreign bodies.

Some ATX motherboards come with an integrated I/O plate.

A notable issue with the ATX specification was that it was last revised when power supplies were normally placed at the top of many old computer cases rather than at the bottom, as with many modern computer cases. This has led to some problematic standard locations for ports, in particular the 4/8 pin CPU power.
Modern power supplies often have longer cables to alleviate this issue.

#### EATX

EATX (Extended ATX) is a bigger version of the ATX motherboard with 12 × 13 in (305 × 330 mm) dimensions.

the extra size of EATX makes it the typical form factor for dual socket systems, and with sockets that support four or eight memory channels, for single socket systems with a large number of memory slots.

E-ATX motherboards and cases are still in production (as of 2020), and support quad-channel memory across 8 slots of ram, up to 4 PCI-e expansion slots for up to 4 double slot graphics cards and a single CPU such as the AMD Ryzen Threadripper 3990X.

Although true E-ATX is 12 × 13 in (305 × 330 mm) most motherboard manufacturers also refer to motherboards with measurements 12 × 10.1 in (305 × 257 mm), 12 × 10.4 in (305 × 264 mm), 12 × 10.5 in (305 × 267 mm) and 12 × 10.7 in (305 × 272 mm) as E-ATX.

##### SSI CEB

The Compact Electronics Bay Specification (CEB) as well as EEB, MEB and TEB ("Thin Electronics Bay") are standard form factors for dual or multi processor motherboards defined by the Server System Infrastructure (SSI) Forum.

 The specification is intended for value servers and workstations based on the Intel Xeon, and AMD Epyc processors (X399/C600 chipsets)

| Name | Form factor (Height × Length) |
| --- | --- |
| Compact Electronics Bay (CEB) | 12 × 10.5 in (305 × 267 mm) |
| Enterprise Electronics Bay (EEB) | 12 × 13 in (305 × 330 mm) |
| Midrange Electronics Bay (MEB) | 16.2 × 13 in (411 × 330 mm) |

##### Ultra ATX

Ultra ATX is an 14.4 × 9.6 in (366 × 244 mm) motherboard form factor proposed by Foxconn during CES in January 2008. In principle, it is simply an oversized version of ATX that supports 10 expansion slots, as opposed to the seven slots of ATX, and it requires a full-tower computer case to support the added height of the motherboard.

Video cards often trend towards double-slot designs, due to the need for a large heatsink to effectively cool the graphics chipset. As a consequence, the expansion slot below the slot used by the graphics card is effectively blocked and cannot be used. This leaves an ATX quad-graphics system with effectively no expansion slots, as all of the additional slots are blocked by the video cards. The main purpose of Ultra ATX is to overcome this limitation and allow high-end systems to incorporate quad-graphics with additional room for expansion.

##### WTX Discontinued 2008

#### Smaller boards

  Extended ATX (EATX) (305 × 330 mm)
  WTX (356 × 425 mm)

Other standards for smaller boards (including microATX, FlexATX, nano-ITX, and mini-ITX) usually keep the basic rear layout but reduce the size of the board and the number of expansion slots.

![Alt text](/assets/images/computer_DIY/image.png)

##### microATX

the popular microATX size removes 2.4 inches (61 mm) and three slots, leaving four.

In computer design, microATX (sometimes referred to as μATX, uATX or mATX) is a standard motherboard form factor introduced in December 1997. The maximum size of a microATX motherboard is 9.6 × 9.6 in (244 × 244 mm).

microATX (µATX、mATX或uMTX)主板标准于1997年12月发表，大小是9.6吋×9.6吋（24.4cmx24.4cm）。它的长度比Standard ATX短20%，Standard ATX标准大小为12×9.6寸。由于长度减少，扩充槽由ATX最多7条减少到4条。

##### Mini ATX

Mini ATX or Mini-ATX is a generic name that may be used by motherboard manufacturers to describe a small motherboard, and has been used by AOpen in reference to a motherboard design with dimensions 15 × 15 cm (5.9 × 5.9 in).

Mini-ATX motherboards were designed with MoDT (Mobile on Desktop Technology) which adapt mobile CPUs for lower power requirements and less heat generation, which may be beneficial for home theater PCs (HTPC), in-car PCs, or industrial use.

The term miniATX was originally used in (now obsolete versions of) Intel's ATX specification, and denoted motherboards with dimensions of 284 x 208 mm (11.2 x 8.2 in.), before being abandoned in v2.1 in favor of the microATX specification. The two terms refer to different specifications and should not be conflated.

##### Mini ITX

As of 2010 Mini ITX has widely replaced FlexATX as the most common small form factor mainboard standard.

From system startup to application launching, Intel® Optane™ memory is smart technology that personalizes and accelerates your computing experience on Intel® Core™-based PCs. It learns your most frequently used documents, images, videos, and applications; keeps them handy for quick access; and remembers them—even after powering off the PC.  
  
Intel Turbo Boost is Intel's trade name for a feature that automatically raises certain versions of its processors' operating frequency when demanding tasks are running, thus enabling a higher resulting performance.
  
Generally speaking, the main difference between the two board types is that the Z590 motherboards permit CPU overclocking, whereas the B560 motherboards do not  
  
the Z590 boards tend to have a greater number of PCIe 4.0 slots available.  
  
The Platform Controller Hub (PCH) is a family of Intel's single-chip chipsets, first introduced in 2009. It is the successor to the Intel Hub Architecture, which used two chips - a northbridge and southbridge instead, and first appeared in the Intel 5 Series.  

multiple graphics cards and a RAID array of PCIe/NVMe storage, or other bandwidth-hungry hardware into your system, these higher-end platforms are definitely the way to go.  

### Components

![Alt text](/assets/images/computer_DIY/image-6.png)

- CPU sockets (or CPU slots) in which one or more microprocessors may be installed.
Given the high thermal design power of high-speed computer CPUs and components, modern motherboards nearly always include heat sinks and mounting points for fans to dissipate excess heat.

- The chipset
The chipset which forms an interface between the CPU, main memory, and peripheral buses

In a computer system, a chipset is a set of electronic components on one or more ULSI integrated circuits known as a "Data Flow Management System" that manages the data flow between the processor, memory and peripherals. It is usually found on the motherboard of computers.

Chipsets are usually designed to work with a specific family of microprocessors.

- Memory slots
into which the system's main memory is to be installed,

- BIOS
Read-only memory (ROM), which stores the BIOS that runs when the computer is powered on or otherwise begins execution, a process known as Bootstrapping, or "booting" or "booting up".
Non-volatile memory chips (usually flash memory in modern motherboards) containing the system's firmware or BIOS

The BIOS (Basic Input Output System) includes boot firmware and power management firmware. Newer motherboards use Unified Extensible Firmware Interface (UEFI) instead of BIOS.  

- Buses
 that connect the CPU to various internal components and to expand cards for graphics and sound.

![Alt text](/assets/images/computer_DIY/image-7.png)

- clock generator
The clock generator which produces the system clock signal to synchronize the various components
The CMOS (complementary MOS) battery, which powers the CMOS memory for date and time in the BIOS chip. This battery is generally a watch battery.

- Power connectors
Power connectors, which receive electrical power from the computer power supply and distribute it to the CPU, chipset, main memory, and expansion cards.
As of 2007, some graphics cards (e.g. GeForce 8 and Radeon R600) require more power than the motherboard can provide, and thus dedicated connectors have been introduced to attach them directly to the power supply.
Power MOSFETs make up the voltage regulator module (VRM), which controls how much voltage other hardware components receive.

- Slots for expansion cards (the interface to the system via the buses supported by the chipset)

- Connectors for hard disk drives, optical disc drives, or solid-state drives, typically SATA and NVMe now

- logic and connectors to support commonly used input devices, such as USB for mouse devices and keyboards.

#### PCIe

PCI-Express(peripheral component interconnect express)是一种高速串行计算机扩展总线标准  

But outside of PCIe 4.0 SSDs, most devices haven't taken major advantage of PCIe 4.0 yet.  
  
there's a limited number of HSIO (high-speed input/output) lanes and PCIe lanes that all of your components must share.  
.  
many mainstream motherboards compensate for bandwidth limitations by switching some connections off when you install hardware in specific slots.  
  
For example, adding a PCIe M.2 drive may disable some SATA ports, or installing a card in a third PCIe slot may disable a second (or third) M.2 slot, etc.  

#### USB

## Graphics card(GPU)

Scalable Link Interface (SLI) is a brand name for a multi-GPU technology developed by NVIDIA for linking two or more video cards together to produce a single output. SLI is an application of parallel processing for computer graphics, meant to increase the processing power available for graphics.  

ROG-STRIX-RTX3060-O12G-GAMING  
12GB 192-Bit GDDR6  
The width of the memory bus through which the graphics data are transferred. The greater the bus width is, the more data the bus can transfer in a clock cycle.  
Effective Memory Clock  15 Gbps
The memory type for all current gaming grade video cards is GDDR5, which mostly runs at a real clock frequency of around 1000MHz to around 2000MHz. GDDR5 uses what is called "quad pumped" technology, which within one clock cycle can do four data transfers. Thus the effective memory clock, or data rate, is 1000MHzx4 to 2000MHzx4. This makes comparisons easier.  
Core Clock 1882 MHz  
The core clock is the speed at which the graphics processor on the card operates, measured in megahertz (MHz).  
2 x HDMI 2.1 3 x DisplayPort 1.4a  
Multi-Monitor Support 4
HDMI (High-Definition Multimedia Interface) is a compact audio/video interface for transmitting uncompressed digital data. HDMI supports ?on a single cable ?any uncompressed TV or PC video format, including standard, enhanced, and high-definition video; up to eight channels of compressed or uncompressed digital audio; and a Consumer Electronics Control (CEC) connection.  
DisplayPort is a digital display interface standard issued by the Video Electronics Standards Association (VESA) since 2006. It defines a new royalty-free digital audio/video interconnection, intended to be used primarily between a computer and its display monitor, or between a computer and a home-theater system.  
3584 CUDA Cores  
A CUDA Core is a single process core in NVIDIA GPU chips. The more CUDA Cores a GPU contains, the more powerful it is (also depending on clock speed, memory size, and frequency).  
CUDA（Compute Unified Device Architecture），是显卡厂商NVIDIA推出的运算平台。 CUDA™是一种由NVIDIA推出的通用并行计算架构，该架构使GPU能够解决复杂的计算问题。 它包含了CUDA指令集架构（ISA）以及GPU内部的并行计算引擎。  
PCI Express 4.0  
Interface is the part of the video card that plugs into your computer's motherboard. It is through interface that your graphics card and computer exchange data. The most common interfaces for video card are PCI Express x16 and x8. PCI Express has undergone several revisions, and the current mainstream revisions are PCI Express 3.0 and PCI Express 4.0. The PCI Express 4.0 is the latest commonly used standard and offers a bandwidth two times that of PCI Express 3.0, while maintaining backward and forward compatibility.  
  
DirectX 12 Ultimate  
Microsoft DirectX is a collection of application programming interfaces (APIs) for handling tasks related to multimedia, especially game programming and video, on Microsoft platforms.  
OpenGL 4.6  
OpenGL (Open Graphics Library) is a cross-language, multi-platform application programming interface (API) for rendering 2D and 3D vector graphics. The API is typically used to interact with a graphics processing unit (GPU) to achieve hardware-accelerated rendering.  
  
Thermal Design Power  
Thermal design power (TDP) is the maximum amount of heat generated by a component in watts that the cooling system needs to dissipate to keep the component in check. It is often a specification for CPU, GPU or system on chip. TDP is not the exact amount of power a component will draw, but can be used as a basic indicator. The higher the TDP, the more power the component will draw from power supply and the more cooling the component will require. To cool the component properly, you need a cooler that is rated at or above the TDP of the component.

### SSD

HDD，Hard Disk Drive的缩写  

NAS（Network Attached Storage：网络附属存储）按字面简单说就是连接在网络上，具备资料存储功能的装置，因此也称为“网络存储器”。  
  
SATA（Serial ATA）硬盘，又称串口硬盘，是未来PC机硬盘的趋势，已基本取代了传统的PATA硬盘。SATA的全称是Serial Advanced Technology Attachment，  
ESATA是一种数据接口。说到外置存储设备（如移动硬盘）的接口  
  
M.2接口是为超极本（Ultrabook）量身定做的新一代接口标准，以取代原来的mSATA接口。无论是更小巧的规格尺寸，还是更高的传输性能，M.2都远胜于mSATA。  
  
NVM Express（NVMe），或称非易失性内存主机控制器接口规范（英语：Non Volatile Memory Host Controller Interface Specification，缩写：NVMHCIS）  
依托于PCIe总线，NVMe设备可适用于各种支持PCIe总线的物理插槽上，包括标准尺寸的PCIe扩展卡（一般是4个PCIe通道）、采用U.2物理连接界面（SFF-8639）的2.5英寸/3.5英寸标准尺寸固态硬盘驱动器、SATA Express总线（兼容于PCIe）的设备、M.2规格扩展卡等。  
在NVMe出现之前，高端SSD只得以采用PCI Express总线制造，但需使用非标准规范的接口。若使用标准化的SSD接口，操作系统只需要一个驱动程序就能使用匹配规范的所有SSD。这也意味着每个SSD制造商不必用额外的资源来设计特定接口的驱动程序。  
  
RAID stands for redundant array of independent disks. This is a type of data storage virtualization technology that lumps physical disk drive components together to drive data redundancy and/or improvement.  
  
A RAID card manages a PC’s hard disk drives or solid-state drives (SSDs) so that they work together and drive redundancy and/or performance. It can be hardware (a RAID card) or software.

### HHD

接口的不同也是 SSD 和 eMMC，UFS 的重要区别之一。  
一个SSD，为了达到高并行高性能的要求，有多个Flash 芯片，这样就可以在每个芯片上进行相互独立的读写操作，以并行性来提高硬盘吞吐量，还可以增加冗余备份。而手机中为了节省空间和功耗，通常只有一片密度较高的 Flash 芯片。  
  
eMMC 和 UFS 都是面向移动端 Flash 的标准  
eMMC 是一个起源较早的技术，全称叫 embedded MultiMedia Card  
MMC前面加了个embedded，主要就是为了突出现在这个设备是embedded 在电路板上。eMMC 和 MMC一样，沿用了 8 bit 的并行接口。  
用高速串行接口取代了并行接口，而且还是全双工的，也就是可以读写同时进行。所以相比 eMMC， UFS的理论性能提高不少，甚至可以达到一些SSD的水准  
  
Universal Flash Storage (UFS) is a flash storage specification for digital cameras, mobile phones and consumer electronic devices. It was designed to bring higher data transfer speed and increased reliability to flash memory storage, while reducing market confusion and removing the need for different adapters for different types of cards.  
  
M.2插槽也是有两种的，一种是金手指有两个缺口的Socket 2跟金手指只有一个缺口的Socket 3，如上图所示。这两种可以走不同的通道，我们后面会说到。  
  
PCI-E跟SATA3简单说就是数据走的“路”，PCI-E就像是特别宽大的路，数据可以走的特别快，而SATA3与之相比更像是一条崎岖的小路，数据走的特别慢，但是CPU内部就那么大一点，修不了特别多的大路，所以PCI-E通道也就仅有那么几条。  
  
 M.2（Socket 2）的固态可以走SATA3或者PCI-E 3.0×2通道(就是两条PCI-E)，而M.2（Socket 3）的固态则可以走PCI-E 3.0×4通道；需要说的是每条PCI-E 3.0的带宽是8Gbps，而SATA 3.0的带宽则只有6Gbps。  
  
AHIC是针对SATA这种弯路的交通规则，然后开发者发现，这种针对弯路的规范，数据只能一个一个通过的规则用在宽敞的PCIE通道上面实在太浪费了，于是针对PCIE通道又开发出了NVME规范，可以让很多数据同时通过。

LPDDR内存全称是Low Power Double Data Rate SDRAM，中文意为低功耗双倍数据速率内存，又称为mDDR（Mobile DDR SDRM），是美国JEDEC固态协会面向低功耗内存制定的通信标准，主要针对于移动端电子产品。  
手机内存总听过吧，手机参数里4GB/6GB/8GB就是这东西的规格，也就是低功耗内存。  
  
同步动态随机存取内存（synchronous dynamic random-access memory，简称SDRAM）是有一个同步接口的动态随机存取内存（DRAM）。  
异步DRAM(asynchronous DRAM)  
  
SDRAM从发展到现在已经经历了五代，分别是：第一代SDR SDRAM，第二代DDR SDRAM，第三代DDR2 SDRAM，第四代DDR3 SDRAM，第五代，DDR4 SDRAM。  
  
G 是英文‘专门’的第一个字母 在显卡上意思就是为显卡专门DDR内存  

DDR=Double Data Rate双倍速率,DDR SDRAM=双倍速率同步动态随机存储器，人们习惯称为DDR，其中，SDRAM 是Synchronous Dynamic Random Access Memory的缩写，即同步动态随机存取存储器。

In the fields of digital electronics and computer hardware, multi-channel memory architecture is a technology that increases the data transfer rate between the DRAM memory and the memory controller by adding more channels of communication between them. Theoretically this multiplies the data rate by exactly the number of channels present. Dual, triple, and quad-channel memory employ two, three, and four channels respectively.

## Power Supply (PSU)

A power supply unit (PSU) converts mains AC to low-voltage regulated DC power for the internal components of a computer.
Modern personal computers universally use switched-mode power supplies.

Dimensions of an ATX power supply are 150 mm width, 86 mm height, and typically 140 mm depth, although the depth can vary from brand to brand.

### Power rating

The overall power draw on a PSU is limited by the fact that all of the supply rails come through one transformer and any of its primary side circuitry, like switching components.

Total power requirements for a personal computer may range from 250 W to more than 1000 W for a high-performance computer with multiple graphics cards. Personal computers without especially high performing CPUs or graphics cards usually require 300 to 500 W.

Power supplies are designed around 40% greater than the calculated system power consumption. This protects against system performance degradation, and against power supply overloading.

Power supplies label their total power output, and label how this is determined by the electric current limits for each of the voltages supplied.

The system power consumption is a sum of the power ratings for all of the components of the computer system that draw on the power supply.

### Efficiency

### Power Supply Connectors

Typically, power supplies have the following connectors (all are Molex (USA) Inc Mini-Fit Jr, unless otherwise indicated):

ATX motherboard power connector (usually called P1): This is the connector that goes to the motherboard to provide it with power. The connector has 20 or 24 pins. One of the pins belongs to the PS-ON wire (it is usually green). This connector is the largest of all the connectors. In older AT power supplies, this connector was split in two: P8 and P9. A power supply with a 24-pin connector can be used on a motherboard with a 20-pin connector. In cases where the motherboard has a 24-pin connector, some power supplies come with two connectors (one with 20-pin and other with 4-pin, i.e. 20+4-pin form) which can be used together to form the 24-pin connector.
12V only power connector (labelled P1, though it is not compatible with the ATX 20 or 24 pin connector): This is a 10 or 16-pin Molex connector supplying the motherboard with three or six 12 V lines with common returns, a 'supply OK' signal, a 'PSU ON' signal and a 12 or 11 V auxiliary supply. One pin is left unused.[34]
12V only System monitoring (P10): This is a 171822-8 AMP or equivalent connector carrying a supply to the PSU fan and sense returns.[34]
ATX12V 4-pin power connector (also called the P4 power connector). A second connector that goes to the motherboard (in addition to the 24-pin ATX motherboard connector) to supply dedicated power for the processor.
4+4-pin For the purpose of backwards compatibility, some connectors designed for high-end motherboards and processors, more power is required, therefore EPS12V has an 8-pin connector.

4-pin peripheral power connector
4-pin Peripheral power connectors: These are the other, smaller connectors that go to the various disk drives of the computer. Most of them have four wires: two black, one red, and one yellow. Unlike the US standard mains electrical wire color-coding, each black wire is a ground, the red wire is +5 V, and the yellow wire is +12 V. In some cases these are also used to provide additional power to PCI cards such as FireWire 800 cards.
4-pin Molex (Japan) Ltd power connectors (usually called Mini-connector, mini-Molex, or Berg connector): This is one of the smallest connectors that supplies a 3.5-inch floppy drive with power. In some cases, it can be used as an auxiliary connector for Accelerated Graphics Port (AGP) video cards. Its cable configuration is similar to the Peripheral connector.
Auxiliary power connectors: There are several types of auxiliary connectors, usually in 6-pin form, designed to provide additional power if it is needed.
Serial ATA power connectors: a 15-pin connector for components that use SATA power plugs. This connector supplies power at three different voltages: +3.3, +5, and +12 V, in three pins per wire, one designed to precharge capacitive loads on for hot-plugging designed backplanes.
6-pin Most modern computer power supplies include six-pin connectors that are generally used for PCI Express graphics cards, but a newly introduced eight-pin connector should be seen on the latest model power supplies. Each PCI Express 6-pin connector can output a maximum of 75 W.
6+2-pin For the purpose of backwards compatibility, some connectors designed for use with high end PCI Express graphics cards feature this kind of pin configuration. It allows either a six-pin card or an eight-pin card to be connected by using two separate connection modules wired into the same sheath: one with six pins and another with two pins. Each PCI Express 8-pin connector can output a maximum of 150 W.
12-pin for PCI Express graphics cards, each PCI Express 12-pin connector can output a maximum of 648 W (12V, 9A), 2 150 W 8-pin can be combined via an adapter cable to form one 648 W 12-pin.
16-pin (12VHPWR) for PCI Express graphics cards, each PCI Express 16-pin connector can output a maximum of 662 W (12V, 9.2A), 12 power pins, 4 contact pins. Introduced on ATX 3.0.
An IEC 60320 C14 connector with an appropriate C13 cord is used to attach the power supply to the local power grid.

### ATX specification for power supply

ATX power supplies generally have the dimensions of 150 × 86 × 140 mm (5.9 × 3.4 × 5.5 in)

That last dimension, the 140 mm depth, is frequently varied, with depths of 160, 180, 200 and 230 mm used to accommodate higher power, larger fan and/or modular connectors.

The ATX specification requires the power supply to produce three main outputs, +3.3 V, +5 V and +12 V. Low-power −12 V and +5 VSB (standby) supplies are also required.

The −12 V supply is primarily used to provide the negative supply voltage for RS-232 ports and is also used by one pin on conventional PCI slots primarily to provide a reference voltage for some models of sound cards.

The 5 VSB supply is used to produce trickle power to provide the soft-power feature of ATX when a PC is turned off, as well as powering the real-time clock to conserve the charge of the CMOS battery.

#### ATX power supply revisions

Original ATX
ATX, introduced in late 1995, defined three types of power connectors:

4-pin "Molex connector" – transferred directly from AT standard: +5 V and +12 V for P-ATA hard disks, CD-ROMs, 5.25 inch floppy drives and other peripherals.
4-pin Berg floppy connector – transferred directly from AT standard: +5 V and +12 V for 3.5 inch floppy drives and other peripherals.
20-pin Molex Mini-fit Jr. ATX motherboard connector – new to the ATX standard.
A supplemental 6-pin AUX connector providing additional 3.3 V and 5 V supplies to the motherboard, if needed. This was used to power the CPU in motherboards with CPU voltage regulator modules which required 3.3 volt and/or 5 volt rails and could not get enough power through the regular 20-pin header.
The power distribution specification defined that most of the PSU's power should be provided on 5 V and 3.3 V rails, because most of the electronic components (CPU, RAM, chipset, PCI, AGP and ISA cards) used 5 V or 3.3 V for power supply. The 12 V rail was only used by computer fans and motors of peripheral devices (HDD, FDD, CD-ROM, etc.)

ATX 3.0
The specifications for ATX 3.0 were released in February 2022.

alternating current (AC) electric power to low-voltage direct current (DC) power
  
A power supply unit (PSU) converts alternating current (AC) electric power to low-voltage direct current (DC) power for the computer. Laptops can run on built-in rechargeable battery. The PSU typically uses a switched-mode power supply (SMPS), with power MOSFETs (power metal–oxide–semiconductor field-effect transistors) used in the converters and regulator circuits of the SMPS.

VRM stands for voltage regulator module. Some modern CPUs and GPUs (aka graphics cards) use VRMs to control and lower the voltage (V) sent to these components in order to avoid exceeding their maximum voltage capabilities. VRMs are especially important for overclocking a CPU or GPU. In theory, VRMs should mean the power supplied to the component is consistent and steady.

Modular  Full Modular
A modular power supply provides a detachable cable system, offering the ability to remove unused connections at the expense of a small amount of extra electrical resistance introduced by the additional connector. This reduces clutter, removes the risk of dangling cables interfering with other components, and can improve case airflow. Many modular supplies have some permanent multi-wire cables with connectors at the ends, such as PC main and 4-pin Molex, though newer supplies marketed as "Fully Modular" allow even these to be disconnected..  
  
Energy-Efficient 80 PLUS GOLD Certified
  
MTBF  >100,000 Hours
Life span is usually specified in mean time between failures (MTBF), where higher MTBF ratings indicate longer device life and better reliability. Using higher quality electrical components at less than their maximum ratings or providing better cooling can contribute to a higher MTBF rating because lower stress and lower operating temperatures decrease component failure rates.  
  
Main Connector  24Pin
The main power connector is used to directly connect the motherboard and the PSU. Two types of main power connectors are often utilized in today's PSU: the 20-pin and 24-pin formats. To provide compatibility with older motherboards featuring 20-pin power socket designs, some PSUs provide 20+4-pin main power connector.  This type of power connector is very versatile, and can easily be used with both 20-pin and 24-pin motherboard. There are more and more motherboards providing 24-pin power connector socket (many motherboards with 24-pin socket can still work with 20-pin power supplies).  
+12V Rails  Single
The +12v is the main power your computer uses. CPU, motherboard and VGA card, along with others components, use it to run. The higher current the 12v rails can offer, the more wattage it can output. Special attention should be paid to the +12v spec if you want to build a SLI/CrossFire setup with multiple VGA cards.

## Case机箱 风扇

A computer case, also known as a computer chassis, is the enclosure that contains most of the hardware of a personal computer.

The components housed inside the case (such as the CPU, motherboard, memory, mass storage devices, power supply unit and various expansion cards) are referred as the internal hardware,

while hardware outside the case (typically cable-linked or plug-and-play devices such as the display, speakers, keyboard, mouse and USB flash drives) are known as peripherals.

peripheral/pəˈrɪfərəl/
附带的
not as important as the main aim, part, etc. of sth

### Case sizes and shapes

Cases can come in many different sizes and shapes, which are usually determined by the form factor of the motherboard since it is physically the largest hardware component in most computers.

Consequently, personal computer form factors typically specify only the internal dimensions and layout of the case.

Tower cases are often categorized as mini-tower, midi-tower, mid-tower, or full-tower. The terms are subjective and inconsistently defined by different manufacturers.

Full tower cases are typically 56 cm (22 in) or more in height and intended to stand on the floor. They can have anywhere from six to ten externally accessible drive bays.

However, as computing technology moves from floppy disks and CD-ROMs to large capacity hard drives, USB flash drives, and network-based solutions, more recent full tower cases typically only have none, one, or two external bays for CD drives, with the internal bays moved elsewhere in the case to improve airflow.

Today, full tower cases are commonly used by enthusiasts as showpiece display cases with custom water cooling, lighting, and tempered glass (replacing acrylic).

Mid-tower cases are smaller, about 46 cm (18 in) high with two to four external bays.

A mini-tower case will typically have only one or two external bays.

The marketing term midi-tower sometimes refers to cases smaller than mid-tower but larger than mini-tower, typically with two to three external bays.

For case fans go for 140mm fans that has the letters AF in them since that stands for AirFlow  
For the radiator you will 95% of the time want to have fans that has the letters SP in them since that stands for Static Pressure.  
  
There are two main stats for a fan. There's the CFM (cubic feet per minute) rating, which describes how good it is at moving air when there isn't any obstruction. There's also static pressure, which describes how good it is at forcing air through obstructions. On a radiator, you need high static pressure, and for case fans, you want high CFM  

in order to make your CPU achieve higher clock speeds than it's rated for out of the box, you'll likely spend extra on an enhanced cooling system and a high-end motherboard. By the time you factor in all these extra costs, you may be better off budgeting another $50-$100 (£40-80) for a CPU that comes with higher clock speeds out of the box.  

## Wi-Fi

Wi-Fi uses multiple parts of the IEEE 802 protocol family and is designed to interwork seamlessly with its wired sibling Ethernet.  
  
IEEE 802.11b: 5.5 Mbit/s and 11 Mbit/s, 2.4 GHz standard (1999)  
IEEE 802.11a: 54 Mbit/s, 5 GHz standard (1999, shipping products in 2001)  
IEEE 802.11g: 54 Mbit/s, 2.4 GHz standard (backwards compatible with b) (2003)  
  
IEEE 802.11n: Higher Throughput WLAN at 2.4 and 5 GHz; 20 and 40 MHz channels; introduces MIMO to Wi-Fi (September 2009)IEEE 802.11n-2009 or 802.11n is a wireless-networking standard that uses multiple antennas to increase data rates. The Wi-Fi Alliance has also retroactively labelled the technology for the standard as Wi-Fi 4. It standardized support for multiple-input multiple-output, frame aggregation, and security improvements, among other features, and can be used in the 2.4 GHz or 5 GHz frequency bands.  
  
a single-band router operates on the (somewhat) newer 802.11n standard, also known as "Wireless-N." Wireless-N routers on a 2.4 GHz band offer theoretical speeds of up to 800 Mbps—"theoretical" meaning that you'll probably never see these speeds during day-to-day use, given real-world factors such as your Internet service limitations.  
  
IEEE 802.11ac-2013 or 802.11ac is a wireless networking standard in the 802.11 set of protocols (which is part of the Wi-Fi networking family), providing high-throughput wireless local area networks (WLANs) on the 5 GHz band.[a] The standard has been retroactively labelled as Wi-Fi 5 by Wi-Fi Alliance.  
  
In addition to supporting the 2.4 GHz Wireless-N standard, dual-band routers support the 5 GHz frequency band, operating on the newer 802.11ac standard. At their theoretical best, that means they support aggregate speeds up to 2,167 Mbps or more.  
  
Beamforming is a radio wave technology that is written into the next generation IEEE Wi-Fi 802.11ac standard. This technology allows the beamformer (Router) to transmit radio signal in the direction of the beamformee (Client), thus creating a stronger, faster and more reliable wireless communication.  
Think of beamforming as a radio transmission from the transmitter to the receiver, customized according to their relative locations. A NETGEAR router with Beamforming+ scans the entire wireless network, understands the parametric of each client, and optimizes the Wi-Fi communication with each client by transmitting focused and directional radio signals.  
  
802.11ac-class device wireless speeds are often advertised as AC followed by a number, that number being the highest link rates in Mbit/s of all the simultaneously-usable radios in the device added up. For example, an AC1900 access point might have 600 Mbit/s capability on its 2.4 GHz radio and 1300 Mbit/s capability on its 5 GHz radio. No single client device could connect and achieve 1900 Mbit/s of throughput, but separate devices each connecting to the 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz radios could achieve combined throughput approaching 1900 Mbit/s.  
  
802.11ac Wave1，确实没什么好介绍的，它就是还没有引入MU-MIMO技术、4空间流以及160MHz频宽的初代802.11ac标准。不过相较于802.11n，在无线传输速率方面，初代11ac依然可以倚靠着新的256QAM调制方式和新的80MHz频宽做到秒杀。  
  
IEEE 802.11ax: High Efficiency WLAN at 2.4, 5 and 6 GHz; introduces OFDMA to Wi-Fi(February 2021)IEEE 802.11ax-2021 or 802.11ax is an IEEE standard for wireless local-area networks (WLANs) and the successor of 802.11ac. It is marketed as Wi-Fi 6 [2.4 GHz and 5 GHz] and Wi-Fi 6E [6 GHz] by the Wi-Fi Alliance. It is also known as High Efficiency Wi-Fi, for the overall improvements to Wi-Fi 6 clients under dense environments. It is designed to operate in license-exempt bands between 1 and 7.125 GHz, including the 2.4 and 5 GHz bands already in common use as well as the much wider 6 GHz band (5.925–7.125 GHz in the US).The main goal of this standard is enhancing throughput-per-area in high-density scenarios, such as corporate offices, shopping malls and dense residential apartments. While the nominal data rate improvement against 802.11ac is only 37%,:qt the overall throughput improvement (over an entire network) is 400% (hence High Efficiency).:qt This also translates to 75% lower latency.  
  
Multi-user MIMO (MU-MIMO) is a set of multiple-input and multiple-output (MIMO) technologies for multipath wireless communication, in which multiple users or terminals, each radioing over one or more antennas, communicate with one another.  
  
Mesh WiFi or Whole Home WiFi systems consists of a main router that connects directly to your modem, and a series of satellite modules, or nodes, placed around your house for full WiFi coverage. They are all part of a single wireless network and share the same SSID and password, unlike traditional WiFi routers.  
  
Comparing range extenders to whole home WiFi is like comparing apples to oranges. Range extenders are certainly effective when it comes to increasing the range of your router, but they do so at the expense of WiFi performance, which gets cut in half.  
You might also experience connection issues when jumping from the router to the extender, because you’ll need to switch networks manually.

### BLUETOOTH

Wi-Fi Protected Access (WPA), Wi-Fi Protected Access II (WPA2), and Wi-Fi Protected Access 3 (WPA3) are the three security and security certification programs developed by the Wi-Fi Alliance to secure wireless computer networks. The Alliance defined these in response to serious weaknesses researchers had found in the previous system, Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP).[1]  

An RF module (short for radio-frequency module) is a (usually) small electronic device used to transmit and/or receive radio signals between two devices.  
  
Several carrier frequencies are commonly used in commercially available RF modules, including those in the industrial, scientific and medical (ISM) radio bands such as 433.92 MHz, 915 MHz, and 2400 MHz.  
  
在无线电发射设备，包括手机（具有Wi-Fi或者蓝牙功能），蓝牙耳机，无线路由器，无线网卡等无线产品上均有体现。  
CMIIT ID即无线电发射设备型号核准代码。  
只有带有我国无线电发射设备型号核准代码的无线电发射设备才是可以在我国国内销售和使用的无线电发射设备。

The network connection style used in classic Bluetooth is a traditional point-to-point connection that looks like the hub-and-spoke model known as a star topology. Devices can only talk to the central controller and not directly to each other. Therefore, the hub must relay message traffic between devices if that is needed for the application.  
  
In 2010, a new version of Bluetooth (Bluetooth 4.0) was introduced, known as Bluetooth Low-Energy (BLE) or Bluetooth Smart.
BLE added a point-to-multipoint/ broadcast model that is useful for a short-range navigation beacon mode

RJ是Registered Jack的缩写，意思是“注册的插座”。在FCC（美国联邦通信委员会标准和规章）中RJ是描述公用电信网络的接口，计算机网络的RJ45是标准8位模块化接口的俗称  
在家用的ADSL Modem（调制解调器）上还会有RJ11接口，它比RJ45接口略小，主要用来连接电话线使用。需要说明的是，RJ11接口为4或6针，而RJ45则为8针接口，所以RJ45插头不能插入RJ11接口，反之RJ11插头也不能插入RJ45接口（虽然在物理接口上是可以实现的）  
  
为达到最佳兼容性，制作直通线时一般采用T568B标准.网络传输线分为直通线、交叉线和全反线。直通线用于异种网络设备之间的互连，例如，计算机与交换机。交叉线用于同种网络设备之间的互连，例如，计算机与计算机。

Electromagnetic interference  
One of the concerns with all powerline systems, when compared to dedicated data wiring, is that the route of the wiring is not known in advance, and is generally already optimized for power transmission. This means that there will be situations where the system will radiate a significant fraction of the energy, in the form of radio frequency interference, or be vulnerable to the ingress of external signals.

## projection

120寸16:9幕布尺寸为2.6*1.5米,  
幕布的大小=投影距离/（ 0.87 X 0.0254 X 投射比）。  
  
有了上面这个公式可以做以下计算：  
  
可以很快的算出多远的距离配多大的幕布了，比如，要投2米远，投影仪的投射比是1.2，幕布最小要买多大尺寸的？  
  
幕布的大小=2 / (0.87X0.0254X1.2)=75寸。  
  
当然也可以根据幕布画面尺寸算投影距离。买的幕布画面尺寸是80寸，投影仪的投射比是1.2，那么投影距离是多少？  
  
投影距离=80X 0.87 X 0.0254 X 1.2=2.12米。  
  
当然，也可以很快算出什么空间配什么投射比的投影仪？比如，想在2.5米远的距离实现100寸的画面，选什么样的投影仪。  
  
投射比=2.5 / (100X0.87X0.0254)=1.13  
  
投射比=投影距离/画面宽度。从这个公式可以看出：该比值越小，说明相同投影距离，投射画面的宽度越大。普通投影机的投射比，通常在1.5-1.9之间。当投射比小于1时，为短焦镜头; 而当投射比达到0.6以下，为超短焦镜头。  
  
如果投射比是一个定值，则表示投影距离固定时，画面大小也固定了，只能调整镜头进行聚焦，但是画面大小不能变化。

There are three main technologies used for projection – DLP, LCD and LED. DLP (Digital Light Processing) uses a chip made of tiny microscopic mirrors and a spinning colour wheel to create an image. DLP projectors deliver sharp images, don't need any filters, have a better response time as well as 3D capabilities. The effective lamp life of a DLP projector is only 2000-5000 hours and some people see colour ghosting/banding in some scenes. On the other hand, LCD projectors use liquid crystal displays, have no moving parts and thus are generally less expensive. If you are on a budget a single chip LCD projector is ideal while 3-chip LCDs offer better colour saturation, lower noise levels and work better for movies. However, LCDs require constant filter maintenance and output less contrast. The LEDs in LED projectors have a lifespan of over 20,000 hours. They deliver better colours, have lower power consumption and virtually zero maintenance costs. Also, LED projectors are smaller and generate less heat. Do keep in mind that LED projectors have limited brightness compared to LCD or DLP so they are not recommended if your room has a lot of ambient light.  
  
5,000 hours is still over three years of use at four hours a night.  
  
 Trigger OUT接口（12V DC输出）对于家庭影院应用来说具有很高的实用价值，主要用于触发电动屏幕或照明控制等外部设备。在打开投影机的时候，幕布会自动放下，照明设备会自动关闭；当关闭投影机时，幕布则会自动收起，照明设备会自动开启，充分享受到智能家居带来的乐趣。  
USB接口确实可以传输音频与视频信号，通用性好于VGA接口。但是，此功能在应用中具有一定局限性，传输音视频时可能会出现一些延迟，因此更适合以PPT、图片为主的商务演示。目前，爱普生、富可视均有部分投影机提供USB传输功能，让你在商务演示之前，不用再苦苦寻觅VGA线，拿一根常见的USB线就足够了。  
网络接口

FHD意思是全高清，即FULL HD，全称为Full High Definition。一般能达到分辨率1920*1080  
  
HD（分辨率<=1280*720）  
  
UHD根据国际电信联盟（ITU）发布的“超高清UHD”标准的建议是，屏幕的物理分辨率达到3840*2160（4K*2K）及以上的显示称之为超高清，是普通FullHD（1920*1080）宽高的各两倍，面积的四倍。

2、对于遮光良好有合适幕布的用DLP会达到出色的效果，例如家用的，卧室用的投影仪。  
  
3、对于遮光不良而且投的画面又比较大的有时只能选择3LCD，例如办公室用的，教室用的传统投影仪。  

### 色域

Wide color gamut (WCG)  
  
色域（Color Space)，又被称为色彩空间，它代表了一个色彩影像所能表现的色彩具体情况,Adobe RGB是由Adobe公司推出的色域标准，sRGB是由惠普与微软公司于1997年共同开发的，其中“S”可解释为“标准”（Standard)。Adobe RGB较之sRGB有更宽广的色彩空间，它包含了sRGB所没有的CMYK色域，层次较丰富，但色彩饱和较低。sRGB对于绿色部分色域覆盖非常少。这个就导致一个很严重的问题，那就是对花草森林等场景的色彩表现力不足。也正是因为这样，它对显示器的要求不高，所以现在市面上大多数显示器都能达到sRGB100%。  
P3 色域广义上包含了 DCI-P3 和 Display P3, 前者是影视行业标准，Display P3 是 Apple 在 DCI-P3 基础上参考了 sRGB 而修订出的自己的标准，在白点和伽马上与 DCI-P3 不同，但是能覆盖的颜色相同，相对于 sRGB 除了蓝色都有较大提升。  
DCI-P3是一种应用于数字影院的色域，它是一种以人类视觉体验为主导的色域标准,最新的标准为Rec.2020  
DCI-P3是一款更加注重于视觉冲击，而不是色彩全面性的色域。并且相对其他色彩标准，它拥有更广阔的红色/绿色系色彩范围。  
Digital Cinema Initiatives, LLC (DCI) is a consortium of major motion picture studios, formed to establish specifications for a common systems architecture for digital cinema systems.  
  
Rec.709是1990年国际电信联盟指定的HDTV的统一色彩标准，它的色彩范围和用于互联网媒体的sRGB色彩空间几乎相同。DCI-P3是美国电影行业推出的一种广色域标准，也是目前数字电影回放设备的色彩标准之一，它呈现的色域相比Rec.709色域大了25%，主要是绿色和红色的范围更广。BT.2020则是国际电信联盟针对超高清UHD（4K及8K）视频制作与显示系统指定的一个标准，这个标准涵盖了分辨率、色域、色深等很多指标，其中色域方面其相比Rec.709具有更大的范围，甚至超过了DCI-P3。

尼特是亮度的单位，1nit=1 cd/m²  
亮度的单位是坎德拉/平方米（cd/m2）亮度是人对光的强度的感受。  
A "nit" is another way to describe a brightness of 1 candela per square meter (cd/m2). An average candle produces roughly 1 candela.  
lumens typically only apply to projectors. It tells you how much light energy something is throwing out, but not exactly how "bright" it will appear. That's because you're not looking directly at a projector. If a projector has "2,000 lumens" for example, it's going to appear differently bright whether you use a 50-inch screen or a 150-inch screen.  
The candela per square metre (symbol: cd/m2) is the derived SI unit of luminance. The unit is based on the candela, the SI unit of luminous intensity, and the square metre, the SI unit of area. The nit (symbol: nt) is a non-SI name also used for this unit (1 nt = 1 cd/m2).[1] The term nit is believed to come from the Latin word nitēre, "to shine"

 oled  
  
This stands for organic light-emitting diode. In an OLED display, the pixels also produce their own light, eliminating the need for an additional LED backlight, making OLED screens super thin. Because each pixel can be individually turned off when not in use, OLED displays create a perfect black, which is why you will see claims of “infinite contrast” on some OLED models.
  
 Today most monitors that use LCD technology are backlit with LEDs, so typically if you’re buying a monitor it’s both an LCD and LED display.  
  
液晶显示器的常用面板有TN（Twisted Nematic扭曲向列型）、IPS（In-Plane-Switching平面转换型）、VA（Vertical Alignment多象限垂直配向型）三种类型，前两种相对常见。  
  
TN屏就是较早前常见的软屏，用手能按出水波纹，这是较早使用的LCD面板之一，目前也在大量使用，因为它的技术成熟，成本低。TN屏响应速度快，可以达到1ms的响应时间，不会出现残影。使用这种材质的屏幕通常用来作为职业电竞屏，通过快速响应，TN屏可无损呈现高速变化的场景细节。  
缺陷也很明显，输出灰阶少，原生只有6bit色彩，画面色彩偏白、可视角度小，显示效果一般，通过不同角度观看会出现偏色和亮度差别。因此，如果你从事设计、影视后期相关工作或在观影娱乐时对屏幕色彩有较高要求，不建议使用这种屏幕。  
  
IPS屏面板较硬，用手指轻触屏幕，画面不会变形。IPS屏在色彩显示、可视角度等方面比TN面板好上不少，对于色彩的呈现范围与准确性也都有亮眼的表现，广视角是IPS面板的原生优势，不论哪个角度观看都不会产生色偏。目前跟影像处理有关的专业屏幕大多采用IPS面板。  
  
为了改良推出了Nano-IPS、Fast-IPS面板，响应时间有了大提升，不少搭配这两种面板的显示器达到了1ms（GTG）  
响应时间超级高的Fast IPS显然更好一些。而想两者兼备的话就选择NanoIPS面板  
  
灰阶响应时间 [1]  ，也就是GTG（Grey To Grey）。说到灰阶响应时间，首先来看一下什么是灰阶。我们看到液晶屏幕上的每一个点，即一个像素，它都是由红、绿、蓝（RGB）三个子像素组成的，要实现画面色彩的变化，就必须对RGB三个子像素分别做出不同的明暗度的控制，以“调配”出不同的色彩。这中间明暗度的层次越多，所能够呈现的画面效果也就越细腻。以8 bit的面板为例，它能表现出256个亮度层次（2的8次方），我们就称之为256灰阶。  
  
MPRT全拼是Moving Picture Response Time，翻译过来叫“动态画面响应时间”，MPRT只是一种降低画面模糊的技术手段，

BC1.2 (Battery Charging v1.2)是USB-IF下属的BC(Battery Charging)小组制定的协议，主要用于规范电池充电的需求，该协议最早基于USB2.0协议来实现。  
BC1.2引入了充电端口识别机制，主要包括以下几个USB端口类型：  
1.标准下行端口（SDP）  
  
SDP端口支持USB协议，最大电流500mA，可以认为SDP就是普通的USB接口  
  
2.专用充电端口（DCP）  
  
DCP不支持数据协议，支持快充，可以提供大电流，DCP主要用于墙充等专用充电器  
  
3.充电下行端口（CDP）  
  
CDP既支持数据协议也支持快充  
  
USB-IF组织推出PD协议（Power Delivery 功率传输协议），有望统一快充市场。  
  
Color accuracy  
ΔE(Delta-E)，指的是在均匀颜色感觉空间中，人眼感觉色差的测试单位·这种测试方法用于当用户指定或接受某种颜色时，生产商用以保证色彩一致性的量度·。  
ΔE值在1.6到之间3.2，人眼基本上是分辨不出色彩的差异，这里只有少数专业级显示器，  
在6.5到13之间时，色彩差别已经可以判别，但色调本身仍然相同。此时市面上大多数消费级液晶显示器都在这个档次上；

CMOS是Complementary Metal Oxide Semiconductor（互补金属氧化物半导体）的缩写。它是指制造大规模集成电路芯片用的一种技术或用这种技术制造出来的芯片，是电脑主板上的一块可读写的RAM芯片。因为可读写的特性，所以在电脑主板上用来保存BIOS设置完电脑硬件参数后的数据，这个芯片仅仅是用来存放数据的。  
  
Complementary metal–oxide–semiconductor (CMOS, pronounced "see-moss"), also known as complementary-symmetry metal–oxide–semiconductor (COS-MOS), is a type of metal–oxide–semiconductor field-effect transistor (MOSFET) fabrication process that uses complementary and symmetrical pairs of p-type and n-type MOSFETs for logic functions.  
  
CMOS technology is also used for analog circuits such as image sensors (CMOS sensors), data converters, RF circuits (RF CMOS), and highly integrated transceivers for many types of communication.  
  
A transistor is a semiconductor device used to amplify or switch electronic signals and electrical power  
  
Transistor–transistor logic (TTL) is a logic family built from bipolar junction transistors. Its name signifies that transistors perform both the logic function (the first "transistor") and the amplifying function (the second "transistor"), as opposed to resistor–transistor logic (RTL) or diode–transistor logic (DTL).  
  
Resistor–transistor logic (RTL) (sometimes also transistor–resistor logic (TRL)) is a class of digital circuits built using resistors as the input network and bipolar junction transistors (BJTs) as switching devices.  
  
A resistor is a passive two-terminal electrical component that implements electrical resistance as a circuit element.
  
Diode–transistor logic (DTL) is a class of digital circuits that is the direct ancestor of transistor–transistor logic. It is called so because the logic gating function (e.g., AND) is performed by a diode network and the amplifying function is performed by a transistor (in contrast with RTL and TTL).  
  
A diode is a two-terminal electronic component that conducts current primarily in one direction (asymmetric conductance); it has low (ideally zero) resistance in one direction, and high (ideally infinite) resistance in the other.

半导体产业中有两大分支：集成电路和分立器件。Discrete device

芯片设计企业（Fabless）、晶圆代工厂（Foundry）、封测厂（OSAT）完成，形成产业链协同效应。
IDM（Integrated Design and Manufacture）垂直整合制造 ，指从设计、制造、封装测试到销售自有品牌IC都一手包办的半导体垂直整合型公司。
Fabless，是Fabrication（制造）和less（无、没有）的组合，是指“没有制造业务、只专注于设计”的集成电路设计的一种运作模式，也用来指代未拥有芯片制造工厂的IC设计公司，经常被简称为“无晶圆厂”（晶圆是芯片\硅集成电路的基础，无晶圆即代表无芯片制造）；通常说的IC design house（IC设计公司）即为Fabless。
Foundry，在集成电路领域是指专门负责生产、制造芯片的厂家。Foundry原意为铸造工厂、翻砂车间、玻璃熔铸车间，从它的字面意思可以看出其与集成电路的联系，因为硅集成电路的制造也跟“玻璃”和“砂”有关。
OEM（Original Equipment Manufacturer，指的是品牌、设计、销售一方和生产一方进行合作的模式，俗称“代工”、“贴牌”；
而ODM（Original Design Manufacturer）则是生产制造商，除了担任制造这个主要责任外，还有部分是自己设计的。
介于两者之间的Fablite模式，即“轻晶圆”模式
OSAT，全称为Outsourced Semiconductor Assembly and Testing，字面意思就是「外包半导体（产品）封装和测试」，是为一些Foundry公司做IC产品封装和测试的产业链环节。

A human interface device or HID is a type of computer device usually used by humans that takes input from humans and gives output to humans.  
Since HID's original definition over USB, HID is now also used in other computer communication buses. This enables HID devices that traditionally were only found on USB to also be used on alternative buses. This is done since existing support for USB HID devices can typically be adapted much faster than having to invent an entirely new protocol to support mouse, touchpad, keyboards, and the like. Known buses that use HID are:  
  
Bluetooth HID – Used for mouse and keyboards that are connected via Bluetooth

 光学指纹头（来自度娘）  
  
借助光学技术采集指纹是历史最久远、使用最广泛的技术。将手指放在光学镜片上，手指在内置光源照射下，用棱镜将其投射在CCD（电荷耦合器件）上，进而形成脊线（指纹图像中具有一定宽度和走向的纹线）呈黑色、谷线（纹线之间的凹陷部分）呈白色的数字化的、可被指纹设备算法处理的多灰度指纹图象。  
  
半导体手续费头（来自度娘）  
  
无论是电容式还是电感式，其原理类似，在一块成千上万半导体器件的“平板”上，手指贴在其上与其构成了电容（电感）的另一面，由于手指平面凸凹不平，凸点处和凹点处接触平板的实际距离大小就不一样，形成了电容（电感）数值就不一样，设备根据这个原理将采集到的不同的数值汇总，就完成了指纹采集。  
  
半导体指纹识别模块只是、识别活体指纹，安全性高，也就是说半导体指纹头可穿透皮肤表发层，所以网上盛传的硅胶模拟指纹在这里基本上起不了什么作用，识别活体指纹锁的好处在于指纹基本上不能被复制或者仿制。  
  
半导体指纹识别模块不易保养，半导体指纹头的采集窗口会受到污渍汗渍以及静电的影响，容易被划花，所以需要使用时注意保护和养护，不然使用寿命难以保障
