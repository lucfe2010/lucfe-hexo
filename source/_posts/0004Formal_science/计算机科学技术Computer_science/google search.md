How to search on Google
Learn a few tips and tricks to help you easily find information on Google.

Tip 1: Start with the basics
No matter what you're looking for, start with a simple search like **where's the closest airport?**. You can always add a few descriptive words if necessary.

If you're looking for a place or product in a specific location, add the location. For example, **bakery seattle**.

Tip 2: Search using your voice
Tired of typing? To search with your voice, tap the Microphone .

Tip 3: Choose words carefully
When you decide what words to put in the search box, try words that are likely to appear on the site you're looking for. For example, instead of saying **my head hurts**, say **headache**, because that’s the word a medical site uses.

Tip 4: Don’t worry about the little things
Spelling: Google's spell checker automatically uses the most common spelling of a given word, whether or not you spell it correctly.
Capitalization: A search for **New York Times** is the same as a search for **new york times**.
Tip 5: Find quick answers
For many searches, Google will do the work for you and show an answer to your question in the search results. Some features, like information about sports teams, aren't available in all regions.

Weather: Search weather to see the weather in your location or add a city name, like **weather seattle**, to find weather for a certain place.
Dictionary: Put **define** in front of any word to see its definition.
Calculations: Enter a math equation like **3*9123**, or solve complex graphing equations.
Unit conversions: Enter any conversion, like **3 dollars in euros**.
Sports: Search for the name of your team to see a schedule, game scores and more.
Quick facts: Search for the name of a celebrity, location, movie, or song to find related information.

quote search

Sometimes people know they absolutely, positively only want webpages that mention a particular word or phrase. For example, maybe you want to find out about phone chargers but only those that support wireless charging. Fortunately, Google Search has a special operator for that: quotation marks. Put quotes around any word or phrase, such as [“wireless phone chargers”], and we’ll only show pages that contain those exact words or phrases.

Now we’re making quoted searches better. The snippets we display for search results (meaning the text you see describing web content) will be formed around where a quoted word or phrase occurs in a web document. That means you can more easily identify where to find them after you click the link and visit the content. On desktop, we’ll also bold the quoted material.

## View web pages cached in Google Search Results

Cached links show you what a web page looked like the last time Google visited it.

> Google Search Console is a web service by Google which allows webmasters to check indexing status, search queries, crawling errors and optimize visibility of their websites.

Important: If you use Search Console for your webpage, use the URL Inspection Tool for debugging.
About cached links
Google takes a snapshot of each web page as a backup in case the current page isn't available. These pages then become part of Google’s cache. If you click a link that says “Cached,” you’ll see the version of the site that Google stored.

If the website you're trying to visit is slow or not responding, you can use the cached link instead.

How to get to a cached link
On your computer, do a Google search for the page you want to find.
In search results, next to the site's URL, click down arrow Down arrow or More  and then Cached.
To go to the live page, at the top, click current page.
Tip: If there's a cached page that you need removed from Google Search results,

## Search for the topic in other ways

If you don’t find the info you want, search for a topic in different ways to get a wide range of helpful info. Some things you might consider:

- Start with a general search, then get more specific.
- Use neutral terms. For example, search cats as pets instead of are cats good pets.
- Use “About this result” to check which of your search terms show up in each result (for example, “cats” and “good” versus “cats” and “bad”).
- Try different search terms.
- If you try multiple searches on a topic and don’t get many relevant results, the topic may be too new or may not have much written about it. You may need to wait and search again later.
- Explore results from multiple sources, not just the top result.
