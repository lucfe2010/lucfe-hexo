html

A markup language is a text-encoding system consisting of a set of symbols inserted in a text document to control its structure, formatting, or the relationship between its parts.[1] Markup is often used to control the display of the document or to enrich its content to facilitate automated processing.

A markup language is a set of rules governing what markup information may be included in a document and how it is combined with the content of the document in a way to facilitate use by humans and computer programs.


most modern markup languages, such as XML, identify document components (for example headings, paragraphs, and tables), with the expectation that technology, such as stylesheets, will be used to apply formatting or other processing.

XML allow designers to specify particular schemas, which determine which elements, attributes, and other features are permitted, and where.

The schemas are a set of 'types', each associated with a set of properties. The types are arranged in a hierarchy.

What is Schema Markup?
Firstly, what is Schema?

In essence, this is part of adding extra information to online content to allow search engines to have a better picture of what a website is about.

This extra information isn't viewed by users on-screen but inserted as part of HTML code. It is a form of microdata, which is read by the search engine spiders when crawling your website. It helps the search engine understand what your page is actually about.

This should be an addition to keywords in your content, which are chosen as means of good SEO practice.

"Schema Markup" is the action of adding this data into your site's coding based on vocabulary from the community at Schema.org. Schema is so relevant because the community is sponsored by Google, Microsoft, Yahoo and Yandex.

Knowing which words to use in relation to your content are pre-determined. There is a hierarchical family tree, if you will, to follow.

These are words which would benefit users if the sites had mark ups installed on them.

Some markup languages, such as the widely used HTML, have pre-defined presentation semantics, meaning that their specifications prescribe some aspects of how to present the structured data on particular media.

Haml (HTML abstraction markup language) is based on one primary principle: markup should be beautiful. It’s not just beauty for beauty’s sake either; Haml accelerates and simplifies template creation down to veritable haiku.

veritable十足的
