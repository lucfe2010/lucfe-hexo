html

A markup language is a text-encoding system consisting of a set of symbols inserted in a text document to control its structure, formatting, or the relationship between its parts.[1] Markup is often used to control the display of the document or to enrich its content to facilitate automated processing.

A markup language is a set of rules governing what markup information may be included in a document and how it is combined with the content of the document in a way to facilitate use by humans and computer programs.


most modern markup languages, such as XML, identify document components (for example headings, paragraphs, and tables), with the expectation that technology, such as stylesheets, will be used to apply formatting or other processing.


markup meta-languages

XML allow designers to specify particular schemas, which determine which elements, attributes, and other features are permitted, and where.

The schemas are a set of 'types', each associated with a set of properties. The types are arranged in a hierarchy.

What is Schema Markup?
Firstly, what is Schema?

In essence, this is part of adding extra information to online content to allow search engines to have a better picture of what a website is about.

This extra information isn't viewed by users on-screen but inserted as part of HTML code. It is a form of microdata, which is read by the search engine spiders when crawling your website. It helps the search engine understand what your page is actually about.

This should be an addition to keywords in your content, which are chosen as means of good SEO practice.

"Schema Markup" is the action of adding this data into your site's coding based on vocabulary from the community at Schema.org. Schema is so relevant because the community is sponsored by Google, Microsoft, Yahoo and Yandex.

Knowing which words to use in relation to your content are pre-determined. There is a hierarchical family tree, if you will, to follow.

These are words which would benefit users if the sites had mark ups installed on them.

Some markup languages, such as the widely used HTML, have pre-defined presentation semantics, meaning that their specifications prescribe some aspects of how to present the structured data on particular media.

ux design

Flutter is an open-source UI software development kit created by Google. It is used to develop cross platform applications from a single codebase for any web browser,[4] Fuchsia, Android, iOS, Linux, macOS, and Windows

A software development kit (SDK) is a collection of software development tools in one installable package. They facilitate the creation of applications by having a compiler, debugger and sometimes a software framework. 

In computer programming, a software framework is an abstraction in which software, providing generic functionality, can be selectively changed by additional user-written code, thus providing application-specific software. It provides a standard way to build and deploy applications and is a universal, reusable software environment that provides particular functionality as part of a larger software platform to facilitate the development of software applications, products and solutions.

Software frameworks may include support programs, compilers, code libraries, toolsets, and application programming interfaces (APIs) that bring together all the different components to enable development of a project or system.

In a framework, unlike in libraries or in standard user applications, the overall program's flow of control is not dictated by the caller, but by the framework.[1] This is usually achieved with the Template Method Pattern.

The intent of the template method is to define the overall structure of the operation, while allowing subclasses to refine, or redefine, certain steps

abstraction抽象
a general idea not based on any particular real person, thing or situation; the quality of being abstract

Abstraction, in general, is a fundamental concept in computer science and software development.[4] The process of abstraction can also be referred to as modeling and is closely related to the concepts of theory and design.[5] Models can also be considered types of abstractions per their generalization of aspects of reality.

A computing platform or digital platform[1] or software platform is an environment in which a piece of software is executed.
It may be the hardware or the operating system (OS), even a web browser and associated application programming interfaces, or other underlying software, as long as the program code is executed with it. 
Computing platforms have different abstraction levels, including a computer architecture, an OS, or runtime libraries.

An application programming interface (API) is a way for two or more computer programs to communicate with each other. It is a type of software interface, offering a service to other pieces of software.
A document or standard that describes how to build or use such a connection or interface is called an API specification. A computer system that meets this standard is said to implement or expose an API. 

In computer science, a library is a collection of non-volatile resources used by computer programs, often for software development. These may include configuration data, documentation, help data, message templates, pre-written code and subroutines, classes, values or type specifications.

### programming  or computer science

Software quality assurance refers to monitoring the software engineering processes and methods used to ensure quality.

Code review (sometimes referred to as peer review) is a software quality assurance activity in which one or several people check a program mainly by viewing and reading parts of its source code, and they do so after implementation or as an interruption of implementation. At least one of the persons must not be the code's author. The persons performing the checking, excluding the author, are called "reviewers"

AI

One of the most exciting recent advancements is in the realm of artificial intelligence (AI), where machines are trained to think, learn, and even communicate like humans. Among the myriad of developments in areas such as generative AI, there's a subtle art that's gaining prominence: prompt engineering.

maraid大量
an extremely large number of sth

prominence出名
the state of being important, well known or noticeable

subtle不明显的;微妙的
Something that is subtle is not immediately obvious or noticeable.
机巧的
behaving in a clever way, and using indirect methods, in order to achieve sth

Imagine having a conversation with a machine where you provide a cue or a "prompt," and it responds with relevant information or actions. That's the essence of prompt engineering. It's about crafting the right questions or instructions to guide AI models, especially Large Language Models (LLMs), to produce desired outcomes.

cue提示；信号
an action or event that is a signal for sb to do sth

prompt提示
to encourage sb to speak by asking them questions or suggesting words that they could say

Kubernetes (/ˌk(j)uːbərˈnɛtɪs, -ˈneɪtɪs, -ˈneɪtiːz, -ˈnɛtiːz/, commonly abbreviated K8s[3]) is an open-source container orchestration system for automating software deployment, scaling, and management.

OS-level virtualization is an operating system (OS) paradigm in which the kernel allows the existence of multiple isolated user space instances, called containers (LXC, Solaris containers, Docker, Podman), zones (Solaris containers), virtual private servers (OpenVZ), partitions, virtual environments (VEs), virtual kernels (DragonFly BSD), or jails (FreeBSD jail or chroot jail).[1] Such instances may look like real computers from the point of view of programs running in them.

 A computer program running on an ordinary operating system can see all resources (connected devices, files and folders, network shares, CPU power, quantifiable hardware capabilities) of that computer. However, programs running inside of a container can only see the container's contents and devices assigned to the container.

paradigm范例；样式

### rust

Rust is a multi-paradigm, general-purpose programming language that emphasizes performance, type safety, and concurrency. 

- paradigm
a typical example or pattern of something; a model.

- concurrency

In computer science, concurrency is the ability of different parts or units of a program, algorithm, or problem to be executed out-of-order or in partial order, without affecting the outcome. This allows for parallel execution of the concurrent units, which can significantly improve overall speed of the execution in multi-processor and multi-core systems.

- concurrent(with sth)

并存的；同时发生的
existing or happening at the same time

Rust has been used in software spanning across different domains. Rust was initially funded by Mozilla as part of developing Servo, an experimental parallel browser engine, in collaboration with Samsung.

parallel平行的

## Lua 

(/ˈluːə/ LOO-ə; from Portuguese: lua [ˈlu(w)ɐ] meaning moon) is a lightweight, high-level, multi-paradigm programming language designed primarily for embedded use in applications.[3] Lua is cross-platform, since the interpreter of compiled bytecode is written in ANSI C,[4] and Lua has a relatively simple C API to embed it into applications

Lua, a language designed for use as an extension language for applications in general, used by many different applications.

A scripting language or script language is a programming language that is used to manipulate, customize, and automate the facilities of an existing system.[1] Scripting languages are usually interpreted at runtime rather than compiled.

A scripting language's primitives are usually elementary tasks or API calls,and the scripting language allows them to be combined into more programs. Environments that can be automated through scripting include application software, text editors, web pages, operating system shells, embedded systems, and computer games. A scripting language can be viewed as a domain-specific language for a particular environment; in the case of scripting an application, it is also known as an extension language.
