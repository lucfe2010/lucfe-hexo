- electrical & electronic enginerring
  - 电气与电子工程,电工电子
  - 电的；用电的；发电的connected with electricity; using or producing electricity
  - 电；电能a form of energy from charged elementary particles , usually supplied as electric current through cables, wires, etc. for lighting, heating, driving machines, etc.
  - 电子的；电子器件的having or using many small parts, such as microchips , that control and direct a small electric current

> the distinction between electrical engineering and electronics is usually based on the comparative strength of the electric currents used. In this sense, electrical engineering is the branch dealing with “heavy current”—that is, electric light and power systems and apparatuses—whereas electronics engineering deals with such “light current” applications as telephone and radio communication, computers, radar, and automatic control systems.
