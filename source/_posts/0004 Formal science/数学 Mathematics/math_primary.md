## Numbers and Place Value

### What is the difference between a ‘numeral’ and a ‘number’?

A numeral is the symbol, or collection of symbols, that we use to represent a number. The
number is the concept represented by the numeral, and therefore consists of a whole network
of connections between symbols, pictures, language and real-life situations.


The same number (for example, the one we call ‘three hundred and sixty-six’) can be represented by different numerals – such as 366 in our Hindu-Arabic, place-value system, and CCCLXVI using
Roman numerals

Because the Hindu-Arabic system of numeration is now more or less universal, the distinction between the numeral and the number is easily lost.

### What are the cardinal and ordinal aspects of number?

> cardinal基数；
> a number, such as 1, 2 and 3, used to show quantity rather than order
>
> ordinal序数词（如第一、第二等）
> a number that refers to the position of sth in a series, for example ‘first’, ‘second’, etc.


s an adjective describing a small set
of objects: two brothers, three sweets, five fingers, three blocks, and so on. This idea of a number
being a description of a set of things is called the `cardinal aspect of number`. 


numbers used
as labels to put things in order. For example, they
turn to page 3 in a book.
The numerals and words being used here do not represent
cardinal numbers, because they are not referring to sets of three things.In these examples, ‘three’ is one thing, which is labelled three because of the
position in which it lies in some ordering process. This is called the `ordinal aspect of number`. 

The most important experience of the ordinal aspect of number is when
we represent numbers as locations on a number strip  or as points on
a number line

There is a further way in which numerals are used,
sometimes called the `nominal aspect`. This is where
the numeral is used as a label or a name, without any
ordering implied. The usual example to give here
would be a number 7 bus.

### What are natural numbers and integers?

use for
counting: {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, …}, going on forever.
These are what mathematicians choose to call the set
of `natural numbers`

the set of `integers`: {…, –5, –4, –3, –2, –1, 0, 1,
2, 3, 4, 5, …} now going on forever in both directions.
includes both positive integers (whole numbers greater than zero) and negative integers (whole
numbers less than zero), and zero itself.

The integer –4 is properly named ‘negative four’,
 the integer +4 is named ‘positive four’, 

`natural numbers are positive integers.`

### What are rational and real numbers?

 include fractions and decimal
numbers (which, as we shall see, are a particular kind of(是一种特殊的) fraction), we get the set of
`rational numbers`.

The term ‘rational’ derives from the idea that a fraction represents a ratio.

The technical
definition of a rational number is any number that is the ratio of two integers.

Rational numbers enable us to subdivide the
sections of the number line between the integers and to label the points in between,

there are other real numbers that cannot be written down as exact fractions or decimals – and are therefore not rational.

there is no fraction or decimal that is exactly equal to the square root of 50 (written as √50). 
This means there is no rational number that when multiplied by itself gives exactly the answer
50.

– we could never get a number
that gave us 50 exactly when we squared it.

But √50 is a real number – in the sense that it
represents a real point on a continuous number line, somewhere between 7 and 8. It represents
a real length. So this is a real length, a real number, but
it is not a rational number. It is called `an irrational number`.

the
set of real numbers includes all rational numbers – which include integers, which in turn
include natural numbers – and all irrational numbers.

### What is meant by ‘place value’?

in the Hindu-Arabic system
we do not use a symbol representing a hundred to
construct three hundreds: we use a symbol representing three! Just this one symbol is needed to represent
three hundreds, and we know that it represents three
hundreds, rather than three tens or three ones, because
of the `place` in which it is written. 

in our Hindu-Arabic place-value system, all
numbers can be represented using a finite set of digits,
namely, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.

Like most numeration systems, no doubt because of the availability of
our ten fingers for counting purposes, the system uses
ten as a base.

Larger whole numbers than 9 are constructed using powers of the base: ten, a hundred, a
thousand, and so on.

The place in which a digit is written, then, represents that number of one of these powers
of ten

for example, working from right to left, in the numeral 2345 the 5 represents
5 ones (or units), the 4 represents 4 tens, the 3 represents 3 hundreds and the 2 represents
2 thousands. 

the
numeral 2345 is essentially a clever piece of shorthand, condensing a complicated mathematical
expression into four symbols, as follows:
(2 × 103) + (3 × 102) + (4 × 101) + 5 = 2345.

Perversely, we work from right to left in determining the place values, with
increasing powers of ten as we move in this direction. But, since we read from left to right,
the numeral is read with the largest place value first

the principle of `exchange`.
This means that whenever you have accumulated ten in one place, this can be exchanged for
one in the next place to the left. This principle of being able to ‘exchange one of these for ten
of those’ as you move left to right along the powers of ten, or to ‘exchange ten of these for one
of those’ as you move right to left, is a very significant feature of the place-value system.

This principle of exchanging is also fundamental to the ways we do calculations with
numbers. It is the principle of ‘carrying one’ in addition

It also means that,
when necessary, we can exchange one in any place for ten in the next place on the right, for
example when doing subtraction by decomposition.

### How does the number line support understanding of place value?

### What is meant by saying that zero is a place holder?

‘three hundred and seven’ represented in base-ten blocks. Translated into symbols,
without the use of a zero, this would easily be confused with thirty-seven: 37. The zero is used therefore as a **place holder**; that is, to indicate the position
of the tens’ place, even though there are no tens
there: 307. It is worth noting, therefore, that when we
see a numeral such as 300, we should not think to
ourselves that the 00 means ‘hundred’.It is the position of the 3 that indicates that it stands for ‘three hundred’; the function of the zeros is to make this
position clear whilst indicating that there are no tens
and no ones.

### How is understanding of place value used in ordering numbers?

It
is always the first digit in a numeral that is most significant in determining the size of the number. 

A statement that one number is greater than another (for example, 25 is greater than 16) or
less than another (for example, 16 is less than 25) is called an inequality

### How are numbers rounded to the nearest 10 or the nearest 100?

Rounding is an important skill in handling numbers
One skill to be learnt is to round a number or quantity to the nearest something.

round a 2-digit number to the nearest ten.

67 lies between 60 and 70, but is nearer to 70
