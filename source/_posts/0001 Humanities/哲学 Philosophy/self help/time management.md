time management

Planning is the process of thinking regarding the activities required to achieve a desired goal.

It involves of various demands upon a person relating to work, social life, family, hobbies, personal interests, and commitments with the finite nature of time.

Using time effectively gives the person "choice" on spending or managing activities at their own time and expediency.

> expediency不得已而做的事
> Expediency means doing what is convenient rather than what is morally right.

ABCD analysis
A technique that has been used in business management for a long time is the categorization of large data into groups. These groups are often marked A, B, C and D—hence the name. Activities are ranked by these general criteria:

A – Tasks that are perceived as being urgent and important,
B – Tasks that are important but not urgent,
C – Tasks that are unimportant but urgent,
D – Tasks that are unimportant and not urgent.
Each group is then rank-ordered by priority - to further refine the prioritization, some individuals choose to then force-rank all "B" items as either "A" or "C".

The Eisenhower Method

Using the Eisenhower Decision Principle, tasks are evaluated using the criteria important/unimportant and urgent/not urgent, and then placed in according quadrants in an Eisenhower Matrix (also known as an "Eisenhower Box" or "Eisenhower Decision Matrix"). Tasks in the quadrants are then handled as follows.

Important/Urgent quadrant tasks are done immediately and personally, e.g. crises, deadlines, problems.
Important/Not Urgent quadrant tasks get an end date and are done personally, e.g. relationships, planning, recreation.
Unimportant/Urgent quadrant tasks are delegated, e.g. interruptions, meetings, activities.
Unimportant/Not Urgent quadrant tasks are dropped, e.g. time wasters, pleasant activities, trivia.

> delegate授(权);
> If you delegate duties, responsibilities, or power to someone, you give them those duties, those responsibilities, or that power so that they can act on your behalf.

A basic "Eisenhower box" to help evaluate urgency and importance. Items may be placed at more precise points within each quadrant.

POSEC method

POSEC is an acronym for "Prioritize by Organizing, Streamlining, Economizing and Contributing". The method dictates a template which emphasizes an average individual's immediate sense of emotional and monetary security. It suggests that by attending to one's personal responsibilities first, an individual is better positioned to shoulder collective responsibilities.

Inherent in the acronym is a hierarchy of self-realization, which mirrors Abraham Maslow's hierarchy of needs.

1. Prioritize your time and define your life by goals.
1. Organize things you have to accomplish regularly to be successful (family and finances).
1. Streamline things you may not like to do, but must do (work and chores).
1. Economize things you should do or may even like to do, but they're not pressingly urgent (pastimes and socializing).
1. Contribute by paying attention to the few remaining things that make a difference (social obligations).

> chres琐事
> Chores are tasks such as cleaning, washing, and ironing that have to be done regularly at home.
>
> obligation义务;责任
> If you have an obligation to do something, it is your duty to do that thing.

#### Implementation of goals

A task list (also called a to-do list or "things-to-do") is a list of tasks to be completed, such as chores or steps toward completing a project. It is an inventory tool which serves as an alternative or supplement to memory.

Writer Julie Morgenstern suggests "do's and don'ts" of time management that include:

Map out everything that is important, by making a task list.
Create "an oasis of time" for one to manage.
Say "No".
Set priorities.
Don't drop everything.

GTD (Getting Things Done)

Getting Things Done was created by David Allen. The basic idea behind this method is to finish all the small tasks immediately and a big task is to be divided into smaller tasks to start completing now. The reasoning behind this is to avoid the information overload or "brain freeze" which is likely to occur when there are hundreds of tasks. The thrust of GTD is to encourage the user to get their tasks and ideas out and on paper and organized as quickly as possible so they're easy to manage and see.
