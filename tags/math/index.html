The<br>number is the concept represented by the numeral, and therefore consists of a whole network<br>of connections between symbols, pictures, language and real-life situations.</p>
<p>The same number (for example, the one we call ‘three hundred and sixty-six’) can be represented by different numerals – such as 366 in our Hindu-Arabic, place-value system, and CCCLXVI using<br>Roman numerals</p>
<p>Because the Hindu-Arabic system of numeration is now more or less universal, the distinction between the numeral and the number is easily lost.</p>

<p>cardinal基数；<br>a number, such as 1, 2 and 3, used to show quantity rather than order</p>
<p>ordinal序数词（如第一、第二等）<br>a number that refers to the position of sth in a series, for example ‘first’, ‘second’, etc.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>s an adjective describing a small set<br>of objects: two brothers, three sweets, five fingers, three blocks, and so on. This idea of a number<br>being a description of a set of things is called the <code>cardinal aspect of number</code>.</p>
<p>numbers used<br>as labels to put things in order. For example, they<br>turn to page 3 in a book.<br>The numerals and words being used here do not represent<br>cardinal numbers, because they are not referring to sets of three things.In these examples, ‘three’ is one thing, which is labelled three because of the<br>position in which it lies in some ordering process. This is called the <code>ordinal aspect of number</code>.</p>
<p>The most important experience of the ordinal aspect of number is when<br>we represent numbers as locations on a number strip  or as points on<br>a number line</p>
<p><img src="/lucfe-hexo/assets/images/math_primary/image.png" alt="Alt text"></p>
<p>There is a further way in which numerals are used,<br>sometimes called the <code>nominal aspect</code>. This is where<br>the numeral is used as a label or a name, without any<br>ordering implied. The usual example to give here<br>would be a number 7 bus.</p>

<p>The term ‘rational’ derives from the idea that a fraction represents a ratio.</p>
<p>The technical<br>definition of a rational number is any number that is the ratio of two integers.</p>
<p>Rational numbers enable us to subdivide the<br>sections of the number line between the integers and to label the points in between,</p>

<hr>
<p>there are other real numbers that cannot be written down as exact fractions or decimals – and are therefore not rational.</p>
<p>there is no fraction or decimal that is exactly equal to the square root of 50 (written as √50).<br>This means there is no rational number that when multiplied by itself gives exactly the answer<br>50.</p>
<p>– we could never get a number<br>that gave us 50 exactly when we squared it.</p>
<p>But √50 is a real number – in the sense that it<br>represents a real point on a continuous number line, somewhere between 7 and 8. It represents<br>a real length. So this is a real length, a real number, but<br>it is not a rational number. It is called <code>an irrational number</code>.<br>利用勾股定理得到平方根数的实际长度</p>
<p>the<br>set of real numbers includes all rational numbers – which include integers, which in turn<br>include natural numbers – and all irrational numbers.</p>
<h3 id="What-is-meant-by-‘place-value’"><a href="#What-is-meant-by-‘place-value’" class="headerlink" title="What is meant by ‘place value’?"></a>What is meant by ‘place value’?</h3><p>in the Hindu-Arabic system<br>we do not use a symbol representing a hundred to<br>construct three hundreds: we use a symbol representing three! Just this one symbol is needed to represent<br>three hundreds, and we know that it represents three<br>hundreds, rather than three tens or three ones, because<br>of the <code>place</code> in which it is written.</p>
<p>in our Hindu-Arabic place-value system, all<br>numbers can be represented using a finite set of digits,<br>namely, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.</p>
<p>Like most numeration systems, no doubt because of the availability of<br>our ten fingers for counting purposes, the system uses<br>ten as a base.</p>
<p>Larger whole numbers than 9 are constructed using powers of the base: ten, a hundred, a<br>thousand, and so on.</p>
<p>The place in which a digit is written, then, represents that number of one of these powers<br>of ten</p>
<p>for example, working from right to left, in the numeral 2345 the 5 represents<br>5 ones (or units), the 4 represents 4 tens, the 3 represents 3 hundreds and the 2 represents<br>2 thousands.</p>
<p>the<br>numeral 2345 is essentially a clever piece of shorthand, condensing a complicated mathematical<br>expression into four symbols, as follows:<br>(2 × 103) + (3 × 102) + (4 × 101) + 5 &#x3D; 2345.</p>
<p>Perversely, we work from right to left in determining the place values, with<br>increasing powers of ten as we move in this direction. But, since we read from left to right,<br>the numeral is read with the largest place value first</p>
<hr>
<p>the principle of <code>exchange</code>.<br>This means that whenever you have accumulated ten in one place, this can be exchanged for<br>one in the next place to the left. This principle of being able to ‘exchange one of these for ten<br>of those’ as you move left to right along the powers of ten, or to ‘exchange ten of these for one<br>of those’ as you move right to left, is a very significant feature of the place-value system.</p>
<p>This principle of exchanging is also fundamental to the ways we do calculations with<br>numbers. It is the principle of ‘carrying one’ in addition</p>
<p>It also means that,<br>when necessary, we can exchange one in any place for ten in the next place on the right, for<br>example when doing subtraction by decomposition.</p>

Translated into symbols,<br>without the use of a zero, this would easily be confused with thirty-seven: 37. The zero is used therefore as a <strong>place holder</strong>; that is, to indicate the position<br>of the tens’ place, even though there are no tens<br>there: 307. It is worth noting, therefore, that when we<br>see a numeral such as 300, we should not think to<br>ourselves that the 00 means ‘hundred’.It is the position of the 3 that indicates that it stands for ‘three hundred’; the function of the zeros is to make this<br>position clear whilst indicating that there are no tens<br>and no ones.</p>

<p>t the two sets do not overlap.<br>They are called <strong>discrete sets</strong>. When two sets are combined into one set, they form what is called the <strong>union of sets</strong>.So another way of describing this addition structure<br>is ‘the union of two discrete sets’.</p>
<p>This notion of addition<br>builds mainly on the <strong>cardinal aspect</strong> of number, the idea<br>of number as a set of things</p>

<p>their age:</p>
<p>in other measurement contexts,</p>

The fact that these two additions come to the same result is an example of what<br>is called the <code>commutative law of addition</code>.</p>
<p>We can state this commutative law formally by the following generalization, which is true whatever the<br>numbers a and b: a + b &#x3D; b + a.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>commutative交换的（排列次序不影响结果）<br>giving the same result whatever the order in which the quantities are shown</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Second, it<br>is important to make use of commutativity in<br>addition calculations. Particularly when using the<br>idea of counting on, it is nearly always better to<br>start with the bigger number.</p>
<p>For example, it<br>would not be sensible to calculate 3 + 59 by starting at 3 and counting on 59! The obvious thing to do is to use the commutative law<br>mentally to change the addition to 59 + 3, then start at 59 and count on 3.</p>

<p>The brackets<br>indicate which addition should be done first. In simple terms, the associative law says that if<br>you have three numbers to add together you get the same answer, whether you start by adding<br>the second and third or start by adding the first and second.</p>

We have to break the 5 down<br>into two bits, 3 and 2. The 3 gets us to the next multiple of 10 (60) and then we have 2 more<br>to count on. This process of using a multiple of ten (60) as a <strong>stepping stone</strong> is an important<br>mental strategy for addition and subtraction. Some writers refer to this process as ‘<strong>bridging</strong>’.</p>
<p>Here is how we might use this idea of a stepping<br>stone for calculating, say, 57 + 28. First, we could<br>count on in 10s, to deal with adding the 20: 57 … 67,<br>77. Then break the 8 up into 3 and 5, to enable us to<br>use 80 as a stepping stone: 77 + 8 &#x3D; 77 + 3 + 5 &#x3D;<br>80 + 5 &#x3D; 85.</p>
<p>A number-line diagram is a very useful image for<br>supporting this kind of reasoning. Children can be<br>taught to use an empty number line, which is simply a line on which they can put whatever numbers<br>they like, not worrying about the scale, just ensuring<br>that numbers are in the right order relative to each other.</p>

In mental calculations, it is much more common to work from<br>left to right. This makes more sense, because you deal with the biggest and most significant<br>bits of the numbers first.</p>
<p>One strategy is to mentally break the numbers up into hundreds, tens<br>and ones, and then to combine them bit by bit, starting at the front end – that is, starting by<br>adding (or subtracting) the hundreds.This process is sometimes called<br>partitioning into hundreds, tens and ones.</p>
<p>So, for example, given 459 + 347, we would think of<br>the 459 as (400 + 50 + 9) and the 347 as (300 + 40 + 7).</p>
<p>The <code>front-end approach</code> would deal with<br>the hundreds first (400 + 300 &#x3D; 700), then the tens<br>(50 + 40 &#x3D; 90, making 790 so far) and then the ones<br>(for example, 790 + 9 &#x3D; 799; followed by 799 + 7 &#x3D;<br>799 + 1 + 6 &#x3D; 806). Notice that I have used 800 as a<br><code>stepping stone</code> for the last step here.</p>
<p>459 + 347 &#x3D; (400 + 50 + 9) + (300 + 40 + 7)<br>&#x3D; (400 + 300) + (50 + 40) + (9 + 7)<br>&#x3D; 700 + 90 + 9 + 7<br>&#x3D; 799 + 7 &#x3D; 799 + 1 + 6 &#x3D; 800 + 6 &#x3D; 806.</p>

<p>For example, many people would<br>evaluate 673 + 99 by adding 1 temporarily to the 99, so the question becomes 673 + 100.<br>This gives 773. Now take off the extra 1, to get the answer 772. This strategy is sometimes<br>called compensation.</p>
<p>The trick in the strategy is always to be on the lookout for an easier calculation than the<br>one you have to do. This will often involve temporarily replacing a number ending in a 9 or<br>an 8 with the next multiple of 10.</p>
<p><img src="/lucfe-hexo/assets/images/math_primary/image-15.png" alt="Alt text"></p>

<p>In everyday life, we often require no more than<br>an approximate indication of what the result should be for many of the calculations we<br>engage with – particularly since, in practice, difficult calculations will usually be done on a<br>piece of technology where the likeliest error is that we enter the numbers incorrectly.</p>

<p>For example, if we all get a 13% increase in our salary, then all our salaries get multiplied by the<br>same scale factor, namely 1.13</p>
<p>Then we also sometimes use this multiplication structure to express a comparison between<br>two numbers or amounts, where we make statements using phrases such as ‘so many times<br>as much (or as many)’ or ‘so many times bigger (longer, heavier, and so on)’.</p>

<h3 id="What-is-the-inverse-of-multiplication-structure-for-division"><a href="#What-is-the-inverse-of-multiplication-structure-for-division" class="headerlink" title="What is the inverse-of-multiplication structure for division?"></a>What is the inverse-of-multiplication structure for division?</h3><p>The actual problems that occur in practice which have this inverse-of-multiplication structure can be further subdivided.</p>
<p>First, there are problems that incorporate the notion of<br>repeated subtraction from a given quantity, such as ‘how many sets of 4 can I get from a<br>set of 20?’</p>
<p>Second, there are those problems that incorporate the idea of repeated addition to reach<br>a target, such as ‘how many sets of 4 do you need to get a set of 20?</p>
<h3 id="What-is-the-ratio-structure-for-division"><a href="#What-is-the-ratio-structure-for-division" class="headerlink" title="What is the ratio structure for division?"></a>What is the ratio structure for division?</h3><p>The ratio structure for division refers to situations where we use division to compare two<br>quantities.</p>
<p>For<br>example, if A earns £300 a week and B earns £900 a week,we could also compare A’s and B’s<br>earnings by looking at their ratio, stating, for example, that B earns <em><strong>three times more</strong></em> than A.</p>
<h3 id="What-about-remainders"><a href="#What-about-remainders" class="headerlink" title="What about remainders?"></a>What about remainders?</h3><p>The mathematical model is ‘32 ÷ 6 &#x3D; 5,<br>remainder 2’. This means that sharing 32 equally into 6 groups gives 5 in each group, with 2<br>remaining not in a group</p>
<p>Remainders do not occur where division is used to model situations with the ratio structure.</p>

Second, it is<br>important to note that the language is sharing<br>between rather than sharing with.</p>

This kind of question incorporates the idea of repeated subtraction from a given quantity.</p>
<p>How many do we need? This kind of question incorporates the idea of repeated addition to<br>reach a target. For example, how many items priced at £6 each must I sell to raise £150?</p>
